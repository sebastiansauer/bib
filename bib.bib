  abstract = {In this study, we evaluated the repeatability of pupil responses to colored light stimuli in healthy subjects using a prototype chromatic pupillometer. One eye of 10 healthy subjects was tested twice in the same day using monochromatic light exposure at two selected wavelengths (660 and 470\,nm, intensity 300\,cd/m2) presented continuously for 20\,s. Pupil responses were recorded in real-time before, during, and after light exposure. Maximal contraction amplitude and sustained contraction amplitude were calculated. In addition, we quantified the summed pupil response during continuous light stimulation as the total area between a reference line representing baseline pupil size and the line representing actual pupil size over 20\,s (area under the curve). There was no significant difference in the repeated measure compared to the first test for any of the pupil response parameters. In conclusion, we have developed a novel prototype of color pupillometer which demonstrates good repeatability in evoking and recording the pupillary response to a bright blue and red light stimulus.},

  abstract = {Interpersonal mindfulness is a construct that significantly contributes to social interaction. To date, no validated measure assessing interpersonal mindfulness has been developed in Iran. Therefore, the aim of this study was to translate and validate the Interpersonal Mindfulness Scale (IMS) among Iranian undergraduate students. Participants in the study (370 undergraduate students; 220 females) from the Azad University completed the translated IMS, the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, and the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems Scale. The translated measure demonstrated acceptable face validity. All items had acceptable content validity and were deemed essential to the scale. The results of a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) confirmed a scale with four subscales (presence, awareness of self and others, non-judgmental acceptance, and non-reactivity), with acceptable internal consistency. The findings support the psychometric properties of the Persian translated Interpersonal Mindfulness Scale, which could be used to measure interpersonal mindfulness among undergraduate students in Iran.}

  abstract = {Background An increasing number of general practitioners (GPs) are not satisfied with their working conditions and are at risk of developing burnout symptoms. As family medicine is becoming a major subject within the medical curriculum in Germany, practicing GPs need to meet higher demands in the future, ie, treating patients and taking part in the education of medical students. Accordingly, we aimed to determine GPs' work satisfaction and risk of burnout. Materials and methods A survey was conducted among GPs in the region of Siegen-Wittgenstein. This area is a representative rural region in Germany. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was used to assess the risk of burnout, while the Work Satisfaction Questionnaire (WSQ) was applied to assess work satisfaction. Canonical correlations were used to examine the association between work satisfaction and burnout in GPs. Results A good model fit was demonstrated for both the MBI and the WSQ. The canonical correlation analysis resulted in two statistically significant canonical functions with correlations of 0.64 (P0.001) and 0.56 (P=0.001). The full model across all functions was significant (q2 [18]=72.41, P0.001). Burden and the global item in the WSQ are good predictors of emotional exhaustion, while patient care, personal rewards and professional relations seem to be good predictors of depersonalization/lack of empathy. This supports the approach to burnout as a multidimensional construct which has to be thoroughly diagnosed. Conclusion Differential interventions tailored to GPs with specific deficits in certain areas should be delivered. GPs with a high score on emotional exhaustion would need a different intervention, as these respondents have different associations with work satisfaction than do GPs with a high score for depersonalization/low empathy. Therefore, the results of this study could contribute to the design of differential interventions aimed at ameliorating symptoms of burnout in GPs.}

  abstract = {Background The establishment of a medical education program in the rural area of Siegen is planned to be the first step against a shortage of physicians in this region. General practitioners (GPs) will be extensively involved in this program as Family Medicine (Allgemeinmedizin) will become a core subject in the curriculum nationwide. Based on this situation we aim to figure out GPs motivation to participate in medical education. For this purpose, we had to construct and test a new questionnaire. Methods A survey was conducted among general practitioners (GPs) in the region of Siegen-Wittgenstein regarding their motivation to participate in medical education. For this purpose, the Motivation for Medical Education Questionnaire (MoME-Q), a 24-item questionnaire, was developed. Structural characteristics of GPs, the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Work Satisfaction Questionnaire (WSQ) were used for validation purposes. Results A representative number of GPs took part in the study (53.8\%). Although the majority had no connection to a university (86\%), 83\% can imagine participating in the education of medical students. The items of the MoME-Q load on two factors (commitment and personal benefit). The confirmatory factor analysis shows a good model fit. Subscales of the MoME-Q were able to differentiate between physicians with and without authorization to train GP residents, between practices with and without a specialized practice nurse, and between physicians with and without previous experience in medical education. The MoME-Q subscale commitment correlated significantly with all three subscales of the MBI. Correlations were in the medium range around |.30|. Conclusion The MoME-Q seems to be an appropriate tool to assess motivation to participate in medical education of GPs. In our sample, a large number of GPs was motivated to participate in the education of medical students. Future studies with larger number of GPs should be carried out to validate and confirm our findings. Whether the MoME-Q is also appropriate for other specialties should also be shown in further empirical studies.}

Although the state of the community is regularly reviewed, the sheer volume of work related to biomedical text mining and the rapid pace in which progress continues to be made make this a worthwhile, if not necessary, endeavor. This chapter provides a brief overview of the current state of text mining in the biomedical domain. Emphasis is placed on the resources and tools available to biomedical researchers and practitioners, as well as the major text mining tasks of interest to the community. These tasks include the recognition of explicit facts from biomedical literature, the discovery of previously unknown or implicit facts, document summarization, and question answering. For each topic, its basic challenges and methods are outlined and recent and influential work is reviewed.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to contribute to greater understanding of the mathematics anxiety construct by: (a) identifying the independent dimensions underlying the item responses on the Math Anxiety Rating Scale (MARS); (b) developing factor scales to measure these dimensions; and (c) determining if specific personal and academic background variables can effectively serve as predictors of math anxiety as defined by the factor scales. The MARS was administered to 197 college students, and the responses were factor analyzed. Twenty-one factors were found; the first two components accounted for approximately 33\% and 7\% of the variance in MARS scores. The first item was labelled Math Test/Course Anxiety, while the second item concerned Numerical Task Anxiety. More anxiety was  stimulated by mathematics test items than by numerical task items. Analysis of variance procedures indicated that students who had taken Algebra II in high school experienced significantly less math anxiety than students who had not taken Algebra II, and those with A's and B's in Algebra or Geometry experienced significantly less math anxiety than did students with poorer grades. It is suggested that student performance in high school mathematics courses be monitored, and early intervention provided. (MNS)},

  abstract = {Individuals with a criminal record face employment challenges because of the nature of their stigma. In this study, we examined the efficacy of using reparative impression management tactics to mitigate integrity concerns associated with a perilous stigma. Drawing on affect control theory, we proposed that the use of 3 impression management tactics---apology, justification, excuse---would differentially affect hiring evaluations through their influence on perceived remorse and anticipated workplace deviance. Across 3 studies, we found support for our proposed model. Our results revealed the use of an apology or justification tactic when explaining a previous criminal offense had a positive indirect effect on hiring evaluations, whereas the use of an excuse tactic had a negative indirect effect. These findings suggest applicants may benefit from using impression management tactics that communicate remorse when discussing events or associations that violate integrity expectations.

  abstract = {Health Psychologists using questionnaires rely heavily on Cronbach’s alpha as indicator of scale reliability and internal consistency. Cronbach’s alpha is often viewed as some kind of quality label: high values certify scale quality, low values prompt removal of one or several items. Unfortunately, this approach suffers two fundamental problems. First, Cronbach’s alpha is both unrelated to a scale's internal consistency and a fatally flawed estimate of its reliability. Second, the approach itself assumes that scale items are repeated measurements, an assumption that is often violated and rarely desirable. The problems with Cronbach’s alpha are easily solved by computing readily available alternatives, such as the Greatest Lower Bound or Omega. Solving the second problem, however, is less straightforward. This requires forgoing the appealing comfort of a quantitative, seemingly objective indicator of scale quality altogether, instead acknowledging the dynamics of reliability and validity and the distinction between scales and indices. In this contribution, I will explore these issues, and provide recommendations for scale inspection that takes these dynamics and this distinction into account.},

  abstract = {It is thought by cognitive scientists and typographers alike, that lower-case text is more legible than upper-case. Yet lower-case letters are, on average, smaller in height and width than upper-case characters, which suggests an upper-case advantage. Using a single unaltered font and all upper-, all lower-, and mixed-case text, we assessed size thresholds for words and random strings, and reading speeds for text with normal and visually impaired participants. Lower-case thresholds were roughly 0.1 log unit higher than upper-. Reading speeds were higher for upper- than for mixed-case text at sizes twice acuity size; at larger sizes, the upper-case advantage disappeared. Results suggest that upper-case is more legible than the other case styles, especially for visually-impaired readers, because smaller letter sizes can be used than with the other case styles, with no diminution of legibility.},

  abstract = {Procrastination is all too familiar to most people. People delay writing up their research (so we hear!), repeatedly declare they will start their diets tomorrow, or postpone until next week doing odd jobs around the house. Yet people also sometimes attempt to control their procrastination by setting deadlines for themselves. In this article, we pose three questions: (a) Are people willing to self-impose meaningful (i.e., costly) deadlines to overcome procrastination? (b) Are self-imposed deadlines effective in improving task performance? (c) When self-imposing deadlines, do people set them optimally, for maximum performance enhancement? A set of studies examined these issues experimentally, showing that the answer is "yes" to the first two questions, and "no" to the third. People have self-control problems, they recognize them, and they try to control them by self-imposing costly deadlines. These deadlines help people control procrastination, hit they are not as effective as some externally imposed deadlines in improving task performance.},

Here we examine the effect of sexual arousal, induced by self-stimulation, on judgments and hypothetical decisions made by male college students. Students were assigned to be in either a state of sexual arousal or a neutral state and were asked to: (1) indicate how appealing they find a wide range of sexual stimuli and activities, (2) report their willingness to engage in morally questionable behavior in order to obtain sexual gratification, and (3) describe their willingness to engage in unsafe sex when sexually aroused. The results show that sexual arousal had a strong impact on all three areas of judgment and decision making, demonstrating the importance of situational forces on preferences, as well as subjects' inability to predict these},

Because subsequent valuations are also coherent with respect to salient differences in perceived quality or quantity of these products and experiences, the entire pattern of valuations can easily create an illusion of order, as if it is being generated by stable underlying preferences. The experiments show that this combination of coherent arbitrariness (1) cannot be interpreted as a rational response to information, (2) does not decrease as a result of experience with a good, (3) is not necessarily reduced by market forces, and (4) is not unique to cash prices. The results imply that demand curves estimated from market data need not reveal true consumer preferences, in any normatively significant sense of the term. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {A regional Swedish hospital has been the site of a quality improvement program that focuses on patient satisfaction, staff work environment and quality of hospital services. This article describes the study component that measures patients' views of the quality of care. The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable and valid instrument, to determine the predictors of patients' ratings of quality and to measure patient satisfaction at two points in time to determine whether patient ratings change following a quality improvement initiative. The instrument developed in this study was designed to assess patients' perceptions of the quality of hospital services, staff work environment and overall satisfaction for the purpose of providing feedback to hospital staff. This information would be used for quality improvement efforts within the hospital. Unique to this instrument are questions regarding patients' perceptions of the hospital staff work environment. The results revealed that the questionnaire demonstrated valid and reliable properties. The significant predictors of quality ratings were information concerning one's illness, and perceptions of the staff work environment. Patient satisfaction was measured and then reassessed following the implementation of various department-based improvement programs. The reassessment revealed significantly higher patient ratings in most areas. An intrinsic aspect of this quality program was the engagement of, and feedback process to, hospital personnel. Questionnaire results were reported graphically to hospital management and staff, thus serving as a catalyst for improvement.},

And yet, the content that is generated from these websites remains largely untapped. In this paper, we demonstrate how social media content can be used to predict real-world outcomes. In particular, we use the chatter from Twitter.com to forecast box-office revenues for movies. We show that a simple model built from the rate at which tweets are created about particular topics can outperform market-based predictors. We further demonstrate how sentiments extracted from Twitter can be further utilized to improve the forecasting power of social media.},

The central idea is to treat the perception process in terms of the evolution of an unstable two-state system. This gives rise to a “Necker-Zeno” effect, in analogy to the quantum Zeno effect. A quantitative relation between the involved time scales is theoretically derived. This relation is found to be satisfied by empirically obtained cognitive time scales relevant for bistable perception.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Satisfaction is considered a valuable measure of outcome of healthcare processes. Only a few anesthesia-related validated questionnaires are reported. Because their scope is restricted to specific clinical contexts, their use remains limited. The objective of the current study was to develop and validate a self-reported questionnaire, Evaluation du Vecu de l'Anesthesie Generale (EVAN-G), assessing the satisfaction of the perioperative period surrounding general anesthesia. METHODS: Development of the EVAN-G questionnaire comprised a phase of item generation and a phase of psychometric validation. The patient sample was generated to be proportionally matched to the population of patients undergoing general anesthesia in France. The structure of the questionnaire was identified studying interitem, item-dimension, and interdimension correlations and factor analyses. Data were concurrently gathered to assess external validity. The discriminant validity was determined by comparison of scores across well known patient groups. Reliability was assessed by computation of Cronbach alpha coefficients and by test-retest. RESULTS: Eight hundred seventy-four patients were recruited in eight anesthesia departments. The EVAN-G includes 26 items; six specific scores and one global index score are available. Correlations between EVAN-G scores and other concurrent measures supported convergent validity. The EVAN-G correlated poorly with age, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, total anesthesia time, and number of previous anesthesias. Significantly higher satisfaction was reported by patients older than 65 yr, belonging to the laryngeal mask group. Reliability and reproducibility were shown. CONCLUSION: The EVAN-G adds important information oriented toward patients' perceptions. The authors' approach provides a novel, valid, and reliable tool that may be used in anesthesia practice.},

  abstract = {Spatial selective attention and spatial working memory have largely been studied in isolation. Studies of spatial attention have provided clear evidence that observers can bias visual processing towards specific locations, enabling faster and better processing of information at those locations than at unattended locations. We present evidence supporting the view that this process of visual selection is a key component of rehearsal in spatial working memory. Thus, although working memory has sometimes been depicted as a storage system that emerges 'downstream' of early sensory processing, current evidence suggests that spatial rehearsal recruits top-down processes that modulate the earliest stages of visual analysis.}

Transcripts of these interviews were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Four key themes were identified within the discourse of individuals affected by HAVS: machismo; coping; psychological impacts; and the development of support services for HAVS. Clinical implications are briefly discussed.}

This definition has evolved from the concept of a unitary short-term memory system. Working memory has been found to require the simultaneous storage and processing of information. It can be divided into the following three subcomponents: (i) the central executive, which is assumed to be an attentional-controlling system, is important in skills such as chess playing and is particularly susceptible to the effects of Alzheimer's disease; and two slave systems, namely (ii) the visuospatial sketch pad, which manipulates visual images and (iii) the phonological loop, which stores and rehearses speech-based information and is necessary for the acquisition of both native and second-language vocabulary.},

These elements of mindfulness can be measured with the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). The authors investigated several aspects of the construct validity of the FFMQ in experienced meditators and nonmeditating comparison groups. Consistent with predictions, most mindfulness facets were significantly related to meditation experience and to psychological symptoms and well-being. As expected, relationships between the observing facet and psychological adjustment varied with meditation experience. Regression and mediation analyses showed that several of the facets contributed independently to the prediction of well-being and significantly mediated the relationship between meditation experience and well-being. Findings support the construct validity of the FFMQ in a combination of samples not previously investigated.},

Our findings demonstrate that the semantic categories represented by the ICNP intervention axes are relevant sources for terminology model components for nursing actions. In addition, our findings suggest that only minimal additions or extensions to the current semantic links of SNOMED RT are needed to support the formal definition of nursing actions such as those contained in PCDS and HHCC.},

Methods: First, we dissected nursing diagnosis term phrases from two source terminologies (North American Nursing Diagnosis Association Taxonomy 1 (NANDA) and Omaha System) into the semantic categories of the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) categorical structure and ISO reference terminology model (RTM). Second, we critically analyzed the similarities between the semantic links in the CEN and ISO models and the semantic links used to formally define diagnostic concepts in SNOMED CT. Results: Our findings demonstrated that focus, bearer/subject of information, and judgment were present in 100\% of the NANDA and Omaha term phrases. The Omaha term phrases contained no additional descriptors beyond those considered mandatory in the CEN and ISO models. The comparison among the semantic links showed that SNOMED CT currently contains all but one of the semantic links needed to model the two source terminologies for integration. In conclusion, our findings support the potential utility of the CEN and ISO models for integrating nursing diagnostic concepts into SNOMED CT.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the psychometric properties of the measure of processes of care for adults (MPOC-A), a measure of client-centredness of care for parents of children with disabilities, adapted for adult health-care settings. DESIGN: A validation study. SETTING: Regional orthopaedic service of a university-affiliated hospital in ON, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: All patients and families who had had joint replacement surgery (Knee or Hip) between January and August of 2007. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: MPOC-A and the client satisfaction questionnaire (CSQ). RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-six questionnaires filled out by patients and 81 by family members were analysed. Scales demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha varying from 0.81 to 0.93 for patients and from 0.88 to 0.96 for family members). MPOC-A domain scores were moderately correlated with CSQ total scores (Pearson coefficients varying from 0.44 to 0.66 for patients and from 0.53 to 0.72 for family members). Moderate to good inter-rater agreement [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) from 0.50 to 0.74] and high test-retest reliability were found (ICCs varying from 0.73 to 0.83 for patients and from 0.75 to 0.91 for family members). CONCLUSIONS: MPOC-A has demonstrated good psychometric properties. As general satisfaction scores are notoriously poor indicators of the quality of care, this measure can help us understand the elements that contribute to overall judgements of satisfaction and provide a level of understanding that is important to improve service quality and delivery.},

It is designed for final-year undergraduates and master's students with limited background in linear algebra and calculus. Comprehensive and coherent, it develops everything from basic reasoning to advanced techniques within the framework of graphical models. Students learn more than a menu of techniques, they develop analytical and problem-solving skills that equip them for the real world.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a meditation program on resting and ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate in youth.    METHODS: Data from 73 middle school students (age 12.3 ± 0.6 years) randomly assigned by classroom to either meditation (N = 34) or health education control (N = 39) groups were analyzed. The meditation groups engaged in 10-minute sessions at school and at home after school each day for 3 months. Resting (seated) systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate measurements were obtained pretest and posttest on three consecutive school days using Dinamap 1846SX monitors. Ambulatory systolic blood pressure, ambulatory diastolic blood pressure, and ambulatory heart rate were recorded over 24-hour periods at pretest and posttest every 20 minutes during self-reported normal waking hours and every 30 minutes during self-reported normal sleep hours using Spacelabs 90207 monitors.    RESULTS: Significant (p {$<$} .05) differences in average change from pretest to posttest were found between the meditation and health eduction control groups for resting systolic blood pressure (--2.7 vs. 1.1 mm Hg), daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure after school (--2.0 vs. 3.6 mm Hg), daytime ambulatory diastolic blood pressure after school (0.1 vs. 4.3 mm Hg), and daytime ambulatory heart rate after school (--5.3 vs. 0.3 bpm).    CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate the potential beneficial impact of meditation on blood pressure and heart rate in the natural environment in healthy normotensive youth.},

  abstract = {Purpose -- This research sets about discovering if it is possible to identify distinct, practice-relevant and addressable clusters by means of selected criteria for constructing typologies -- such as psychographic, culturally-specific and purchasing behaviour-relevant features -- which permit an online supplier to efficiently and effectively focus on attractive consumer segments. Design/methodology/approach -- To answer the research question, the study conducted an online survey with 1,011 participants. The respondents were from three countries, each with culturally-distinct features: France, Germany and the US. Underpinning the research are theoretically-secured constructs of purchasing behaviour on the internet. Findings -- Cluster analysis confirmed the outstanding validity of a three-cluster-solution (97.7 per cent score) -- risk-averse doubters, open-minded online shoppers, and reserved information-seekers. Discriminant analysis shows that certain constructs, particularly “neuroticism”, “willingness to buy” and “shopping pleasure”, separate the clusters best. Research limitations/implications -- An extension of our clustering approach to more countries and especially non-western cultures promises interesting results. Furthermore, researchers are encouraged to enlarge the catalogue of clustering variables to allow an even more specific fine-tuning of the main clusters identified in this research. Practical implications -- The classification created provides the potential for a much closer fit between a company's goods and services and heterogeneous customer needs. Originality/value -- The principal contribution of the paper is the identification of three different clusters of internet users. This can be of good use for shaping internet marketing, particularly by virtue of the likely stability over time from cultural and personality characteristics.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: recent studies have found that moderate intensity exercise is an effective intervention strategy for preventing falls in older people. However, research is required to determine whether supervised group exercise programmes, conducted in community settings with at-risk older people referred by their health care practitioner are also effective in improving physical functioning and preventing falls in this group. OBJECTIVES: to determine whether participation in a weekly group exercise programme with ancillary home exercises over one year improves balance, muscle strength, reaction time, physical functioning, health status and prevents falls in at-risk community-dwelling older people. METHODS: the sample comprised 163 people aged over 65 years identified as at risk of falling using a standardised assessment screen by their general practitioner or hospital-based physiotherapist, residing in South Western Sydney, Australia. Subjects were randomised into either an exercise intervention group or a control group. Physical performance and general health measures were assessed at baseline and repeated 6-months into the trial. Falls were measured over a 12-month follow-up period using monthly postal surveys. RESULTS: at baseline both groups were well matched in their physical performance, health and activity levels. The intervention subjects attended a median of 23 exercise classes over the year, and most undertook the home exercise sessions at least weekly. At retest, the exercise group performed significantly better than the controls in three of six balance measures; postural sway on the floor with eyes open and eyes closed and coordinated stability. The groups did not differ at retest in measures of strength, reaction time and walking speed or on Short-Form 36, Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly or fear of falling scales. Within the 12-month trial period, the rate of falls in the intervention group was 40\% lower than that of the control group (IRR=0.60, 95\% CI 0.36-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: these findings indicate that participation in a weekly group exercise programme with ancillary home exercises can improve balance and reduce the rate of falling in at-risk community dwelling older people.},

  abstract = {McGrath (2005/this issue) has published a very significant article; it is significant because it examines the substantive issue of construct validity in a simple and informative way, noting the confusions apparent in how constructs and their variables are defined, used, and interpreted within the domain of personality and individual differences. This is a careful, thoughtful, article that quietly proceeds to outline the problems with current thinking and approaches to defining and using constructs in psychology. McGrath also suggests how some of these problems might be addressed. I note that McGrath appears to miss what might be considered an obvious rejoinder to some of his arguments, that is, the use of latent variable and item response theory. Some consideration is given to these arguments. However, a cursory examination shows that although these new methodologies offer many opportunities for new stochastic questionnaire data modeling and the construction of "instant" latent variables, the same problems caused by lack of attention to measurement and meaning remain. I find I am in agreement with many of the author's views and arguments, but I also find myself wondering whether modern psychometrics and individual differences research methods is now so dominated by psychological statisticians that any thought of substantive scientific innovation in this area that deals more properly with measurement and meaning is long gone. I think the answers to the question "What if there was no psychometrics?" would be most illuminating.},

If we are to make progress in this field then we must be able to compare the results from different studies. A~literature review has been performed on the measurements of five key concepts in HRI: anthropomorphism, animacy, likeability, perceived intelligence, and perceived safety. The results have been distilled into five consistent questionnaires using semantic differential scales. We report reliability and validity indicators based on several empirical studies that used these questionnaires. It is our hope that these questionnaires can be used by robot developers to monitor their progress. Psychologists are invited to further develop the questionnaires by adding new concepts, and to conduct further validations where it appears necessary.},

  abstract = {The International Council of Nurses (ICN) is a federation of 129 national nurses associations. The International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP) is a programme of the ICN. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and maintenance processes of the ICNP Programme that are used to increase participation. These include processes by which the ICNP was and continues to be developed, tested, distributed and implemented worldwide, with emphasis on the current version, ICNP Version 1.0. The ICNP is a unified nursing language that facilitates cross-mapping among local terms and existing terminologies. ICNP conforms to current terminology standards and criteria, for example, ISO standards and HL7. The ICNP Alpha and Beta Versions documented the progress of concept validation and classification of nursing phenomena and interventions. The ICNP Beta 2 Version was a combinatorial terminology organized in two multi-axial structures representing nursing phenomena and nursing actions. The ICNP Version 1.0, launched in 2005, changed the relatively straight-forward multi-axial structure into a compositional terminology through the application of description logics using Web Ontology Language (OWL) within Protégé, an ontology development environment. ICNP Version 1.0 is also represented in a multiaxial model (7-Axis) for nurses to compose nursing diagnosis, intervention and outcome statements. Language translations and clinical information systems applications are required to make the ICNP Version 1.0 available to nurses at the point of healthcare delivery. ICNP data collected in healthcare environments provide standardized terminology for nursing that allows comparison of nursing practice across health care settings, specialties and countries; facilitate data-based clinical and management decision making; and contribute to the development of guidelines and standards for best practices and optimal outcomes for patients, families and communities.},

In Experiment 1, people who forced themselves to eat radishes instead of tempting chocolates subsequently quit faster on unsolvable puzzles than people who had not had to exert self-control over eating. In Experiment 2, making a meaningful personal choice to perform attitude-relevant behavior caused a similar decrement in persistence. In Experiment 3, suppressing emotion led to a subsequent drop in performance of solvable anagrams. In Experiment 4, an initial task requiring high self-regulation made people more passive (i.e., more prone to favor the passive-response option). These results suggest that the self's capacity for active volition is limited and that a range of seemingly different, unrelated acts share a common resource.},

The human genome encodes two PHB proteins, prohibitin 1 (PHB1) and prohibitin 2 (PHB2), which function not only as a heterodimeric complex, but also independently. While many previous reviews have focused on the better characterized prohibitin, PHB1, this review focuses on PHB2 and new data concerning its cellular functions both in complex with PHB1 and independent of PHB1.},

Even in situations where the hypothesis testing paradigm is correct, the common practice of basing inferences solely on p-values has been under intense criticism for over 50 years. We propose, as an alternative, the use of the odds of a correct rejection of the null hypothesis to incorrect rejection. Both pre-experimental versions (involving the power and Type I error) and post-experimental versions (depending on the actual data) are considered. Implementations are provided that range from depending only on the p-value to consideration of full Bayesian analysis. A surprise is that all implementations–even the full Bayesian analysis–have complete frequentist justification. Versions of our proposal can be implemented that require only minor modifications to existing practices yet overcome some of their most severe shortcomings.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To quantify women's satisfaction with delivery care in informal settlements of Nairobi, Kenya, and to determine characteristics of women and delivery care associated with satisfaction. DESIGN: Household survey data analysis of 1266 women who delivered in health facilities in 2004 or 2005. SETTING: Two densely populated informal settlements 7 and 12 km from Nairobi's center, where residents work primarily in the nearby industrial area or in the informal sector. Outcome Satisfaction was assessed by whether women would recommend the delivery care facility and deliver there again. RESULTS: Over half (56\%) of women would both recommend and deliver again in the same facility. In multivariate analysis, women's satisfaction with delivery care was associated with greater provider empathy (OR = 3.68, 95\% CI 2.27, 5.97). Women's satisfaction with delivery care was also associated with the pregnancy having been wanted (OR = 2.75, 95\% CI 1.82, 4.14) or mistimed vs. unwanted. Women delivering at private facilities in the settlement near the industrial area were more satisfied than women delivering at private facilities in the more distant and marginalized settlement (OR = 2.12, 95\% CI 1.45, 3.09). The association of women's satisfaction and provider empathy was stronger among women who experienced complications compared to those who did not. CONCLUSION: Health providers should be sensitized to the finding that unintended pregnancy is associated with lower satisfaction with delivery care. Maternal health programmes should focus on increasing provider empathy, especially for women who experience complications, in both private and government health facilities.},

By use of logistic models (Rasch) the consistency of the HDS has been considered across patient-variables as age, sex, plasma levels of imipramine, and diagnosis. The results showed that the original 17-item HDS was without adequate consistency, i.e. the total score of the sample of items was no one-dimensional measure of depressive states. However, a melancholia subscale of the HDS contained items the total of which can be used to compare patients quantitatively, although in some part of the analysis one of these items showed ceiling effect. It was concluded that the melancholia sub-scale (containing the items depressed mood, guilt, work and interests, retardation, psychic anxiety, and general somatic symptoms) can form the basis for further improvements in the field of quantitative rating scales for depressive states.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Sleep loss and sleep disruption are common in critically ill patients and may adversely affect clinical outcomes. Although polysomnography remains the most accurate and reliable way to measure sleep, it is costly and impractical for regular use in the intensive care unit. This study evaluates the accuracy of two other methods currently used for measuring sleep, actigraphy (monitoring of gross motor activity) and behavioural assessment by the bedside nurse, by comparing them to overnight polysomnography in critically ill patients. DESIGN: Observational study with simultaneous polysomnography, actigraphy and behavioural assessment of sleep. SETTING: Medical-surgical intensive care unit. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Twelve stable, critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients [68 (13) years, Glasgow coma scale 11 (0)]. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep was severely disrupted, reflected by decreased total sleep time and sleep efficiency, high frequency of arousals and awakenings and abnormal sleep architecture. Actigraphy overestimated total sleep time and sleep efficiency. The overall agreement between actigraphy and polysomnography was {$<$}65\%. Nurse assessment underestimated the number of awakenings from sleep. Estimated total sleep time, sleep efficiency and number of awakenings by nurse assessment did not correlate with polysomnographic findings. CONCLUSIONS: Actigraphy and behavioural assessment by the bedside nurse are inaccurate and unreliable methods to monitor sleep in critically ill patients.},

In biomedical research, we are in the midst of a revolution with the generation of new data and scientific publications at a previously unprecedented rate. However, unfortunately, there is compelling evidence that the majority of these discoveries will not stand the test of time. To a large extent, this reproducibility crisis in basic and preclinical research may be as a result of failure to adhere to good scientific practice and the desperation to publish or perish. This is a multifaceted, multistakeholder problem. No single party is solely responsible, and no single solution will suffice. Here we review the reproducibility problems in basic and preclinical biomedical research, highlight some of the complexities, and discuss potential solutions that may help improve research quality and reproducibility.}

Many emerging adults arrive at this developmental stage feeling the pressure and obligation for success, but lack the interpersonal resources needed to make required choices. The purpose of this study was to provide insight into the psychological and mental state of this particular group by focusing on mechanisms of self-awareness and its connection to psychological health. The present study examines whether an indirect path could explain the relationships between mindfulness, positive thinking, and positive affect. Path analysis was used to test whether decentering fosters positive thinking and positive affect. Participants were surveyed for dispositional mindfulness, frequency of positive and negative feelings, positive thinking, and rumination. Results show decentering mediates between mindfulness and positive affect but does not mediate between mindfulness and positive thinking. Rumination counteracts the effects of mindfulness and predicts negative affect.},

  abstract = {Obwohl Messungen zur Arbeitszufriedenheit und -motivation gerne als interne Angelegenheit durchgeführt werden und die Messwerte auch häufigintern bleiben, können veröffentlichte Untersuchungen stellvertretend Aussagen zu Einstellungen zur Organisation, Arbeit und Arbeitsumfeld aufzeigen. Gutknecht (2005/06) befragte zwischen 2003 und 2005 knapp 400 Arbeitnehmende aus der IT-Branche und dem Berufsmilitär bezüglich ihrer organisationsspezifi schen Einstellungen. Seine Ergebnisse beziehen sich besonders auf die Wahrnehmung von belastenden zwischenmenschlichen Beziehungen in der Organisation. Gutknecht geht davon aus, dass diese Wahrnehmung sich indirekt negativ auf die Einstellung der Organisation gegenüber auswirkt. Nachfolgend sind jene Ergebnisse dargestellt, die besonders deutlich hervorgetreten sind: * Das »Commitment« hat sich in allen Stichproben als der beste Prädiktor hinsichtlich der Kündigungsabsichten herausstellt. Als besonders relevant zur Vorhersage des »Commitments« bezeichnet Gutknecht die Kontextfaktoren: »Während die Zufriedenheit mit den Kollegen, mit der Arbeitsplatzsicherheit und in geringerem Ausmaß mit der Höhe des Lohns verhältnismäßig groß ist, werden die Facetten Lohngerechtigkeit, Zukunftsaussichten und der Führungsstil in der Organisation weniger gut beurteilt«. * Der Führungsstil ist durchweg kritisch beurteilt worden -- sowohl auf Stufe der Organisation wie auch in Bezug zu Chef-Mitarbeiter- Beziehungen. Dabei zeigt sich, dass die Beziehung zwischen Arbeitnehmenden und Vorgesetzten bedeutsam sein kann: »Unabhängig von Rang, Alter oder auch Arbeitszeit sind Personen, die von einer guten Beziehung zum Vorgesetzten berichten, allgemein zufriedener, resignieren weniger und generieren auch in unsicheren Zeiten weniger Kündigungsabsichten. Zudem beurteilen sie das intrinsische Motivationspotenzial wie auch die Kontextfaktoren vorteilhafter, selbst wenn in vielen Fällen diese Aspekte vom direkten Vorgesetzten kaum aktiv beeinfl usst werden dürften«. * Die Frage, ob »der direkte Vorgesetzte die Entwicklungsmöglichkeiten des Unterstellten erkennt«, verneinen viele der Befragten in beiden Stichproben. Darüber hinaus werden aber auch mangelnde Unterstützung, fehlender Respekt und mangelnde Fairness als Mangel in der Beziehung zum Vorgesetzten mitgeteilt.},

Faktorenanalytische Verfahren ergaben eine achtfaktorielle Struktur. Die Struktur wurde in einer zusätzlichen konfirmatorischen Stichprobe ( N = 202) überprüft. Der Fragebogen sowie seine Unterskalen weisen gute Reliabilitätswerte auf (interne Konsistenz und Retest-Reliabilität). Analysen zur Messinvarianz der einzelnen Items über Gruppen, die sich bezüglich Meditationserfahrung, Alter, Geschlecht und Symptombelastung unterschieden, zeigten keine systematischen Unterschiede im Verständnis der Items. Die Kennwerte zur Konstrukt-, Kriterium-, und inkrementellen Validität sowie zur Veränderungssensitivität waren alle mindestens zufriedenstellend. Mit dem CHIME steht somit ein Fragebogen mit guten psychometrischen Eigenschaften zur Selbsteinschätzung der Achtsamkeit zur Verfügung.

  abstract = {During recent years, mindfulness-based approaches have been gaining relevance for treatment in clinical populations. Correspondingly, the empirical study of mindfulness has steadily grown; thus, the availability of valid measures of the construct is critically important. This paper gives an overview of the current status in the field of self-report assessment of mindfulness. All eight currently available and validated mindfulness scales (for adults) are evaluated, with a particular focus on their virtues and limitations and on differences among them. It will be argued that none of these scales may be a fully adequate measure of mindfulness, as each of them offers unique advantages but also disadvantages. In particular, none of them seems to provide a comprehensive assessment of all aspects of mindfulness in samples from the general population. Moreover, some scales may be particularly indicated in investigations focusing on specific populations such as clinical samples (Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale, Southampton Mindfulness Questionnaire) or meditators (Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory). Three main open issues are discussed: (1) the coverage of aspects of mindfulness in questionnaires; (2) the nature of the relationships between these aspects; and (3) the validity of self-report measures of mindfulness. These issues should be considered in future developments in the self-report assessment of mindfulness.},

  abstract = {Objectives. To assess whether talking or reading (silently or aloud) could affect heart rate variability (HRV) and to what extent these changes require a simultaneous recording of respiratory activity to be correctly interpreted. Background. Sympathetic predominance in the power spectrum obtained from short- and long-term HRV recordings predicts a poor prognosis in a number of cardiac diseases. Heart rate variability is often recorded without measuring respiration; slow breaths might artefactually increase low frequency power in RR interval (RR) and falsely mimic sympathetic activation. Methods. In 12 healthy volunteers we evaluated the effect of free talking and reading, silently and aloud, on respiration, RR and blood pressure (BP). We also compared spontaneous breathing to controlled breathing and mental arithmetic, silent or aloud. The power in the so called low-(LF) and high-frequency (HF) bands in RR and BP was obtained from autoregressive power spectrum analysis. Results. Compared with spontaneous breathing, reading silently increased the speed of breathing (p {$<$} 0.05), decreased mean RR and RR variability and increased BP. Reading aloud, free talking and mental arithmetic aloud shifted the respiratory frequency into the LF band, thus increasing LF\% and decreasing HF\% to a similar degree in both RR and respiration, with decrease in mean RR but with minor differences in crude RR variability. Conclusions. Simple mental and verbal activities markedly affect HRV through changes in respiratory frequency. This possibility should be taken into account when analyzing HRV without simultaneous acquisition and analysis of respiration. (C) 2000 by the American College of Cardiology.},

The key performance dimensions include: (1) Link Best Practices to Strategy Fulfillment (2) Best Practice Identification Systems (3) Best Practice Recognition Systems (4) Communicating Best Practices (5) Best Practice Knowledge Sharing Systems (6) Ongoing Nurturing of Best Practices Graphical Presentations, Best Practice Project Maps and Research Organization: The sub-elements to the fully integrated performance system are graphically depicted at the start of the report. At the start of each chapter, a Best Practice Project Map describes: (1) the class of benchmark companies examined in the chapter, (2) the key performance dimensions of the project with the chapter concentration highlighted, and (3) the recommended practices identified among the benchmark class in that sub-element. Best Practice Corporate Profiles, Information Graphics: Best practice descriptions and information are organized and presented under the thematic headings or sub-elements for each performance system. Highly effective practices are identified in bold-faced type and are followed by detailed descriptions of individual companies specific systems and approaches to these practices. For instance, a practice under Communicating Best Practices such as Ensure Communication Among Line and Staff Management is illustrated by a discussion of the various methods Wal-Mart uses to ensure corporate-wide communication (including Saturday morning executive meetings, and video links connecting all stores). At times, the corporate profiles will go into great depth and detail describing a benchmark company's integrated approach to the subject area. Other times the profile will be brief and illustrate a single relevant practice. When relevant, the research team has developed tables and information graphics to visually illustrate key practice areas. Research Sources Tables: Lastly, the report contains a Summary Table detailing the full extent of research sources employed to develop each set of benchmark profiles.

  abstract = {Most statistical analyses use hypothesis tests or estimation about parameters to form inferential conclusions. I think this is noble, but misguided. The point of view expressed here is that observables are fundamental, and that the goal of statistical modeling should be to predict future observations, given the current data and other relevant information. Further, the prediction of future observables provides multiple advantages to practicing scientists, and to science in general. These include an interpretable numerical summary of a quantity of direct interest to current and future researchers, a calibrated prediction of what’s likely to happen in future experiments, a prediction that can be either “corroborated” or “refuted” through experimentation, and avoidance of inference about parameters; quantities that exists only as convenient indices of hypothetical distributions. Finally, the predictive probability of a future observable can be used as a standard for communicating the reliability of the current work, regardless of whether confirmatory experiments are conducted. Adoption of this paradigm would improve our rigor for scientific accuracy and reproducibility by shifting our focus from “finding differences” among hypothetical parameters to predicting observable events based on our current scientific understanding.},

Subjects are given an individual endowment and vote by majority rule to either keep the endowment for private use or to donate it to a non-governmental organization. In our experiment, participants are divided at random in two treatments. Individuals in both treatments are provided with true yet diverging information regarding the approval rates observed in previous experimental sessions. Our results show that the voting behavior differs across treatments in a way that is consistent with bandwagon voting. They also confirm the importance of instrumental motives and -- unlike the majority of previous experiments -- find support for expressive voting motives. Finally, we assess the impact of the false-consensus effect from a theoretical perspective. We show that it has the potential to change voter behavior if it results from an anchoring bias and voters follow non-instrumental motives.},

There has been widespread and growing use of this approach within medical settings in the last 20 years, and many claims have been made regarding its efficacy. This article will provide a critical evaluation of the available state of knowledge regarding MBSR and suggestions for future research.: A review of the current literature available within the medical and social sciences was undertaken to provide an evaluation regarding what we know about the construct of mindfulness, the effectiveness of MBSR, and mechanisms of action.: There has been a paucity of research and what has been published has been rife with methodological problems. At present, we know very little about the effectiveness of this approach. However, there is some evidence that suggests that it may hold some promise.: The available evidence does not support a strong endorsement of this approach at present. However, serious investigation is warranted and strongly recommended.},

  abstract = {The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) has the longest empirical track record as a valid measure of trait mindfulness. Most of what is understood about trait mindfulness comes from administering the MAAS to relatively homogenous samples of Caucasian adults. This study rigorously evaluates the psychometric properties of the MAAS among Chinese adolescents attending high school in Chengdu, China. Classrooms from 24 schools were randomly selected to participate in the study. Three waves of longitudinal data (N = 5,287 students) were analyzed. MAAS construct, nomological, and incremental validity were evaluated as well as its measurement invariance across gender using latent factor analyses. Participants' mean age was 16.2 years (SD = 0.7), and 51\% were male. The 15-item MAAS had adequate fit to the one-dimensional factor structure at Wave 1, and this factor structure was replicated at Wave 2. A 6-item short scale of the MAAS fit well to the data at Wave 3. The MAAS maintained reliability (Cronbach's α = .89-.93; test--restest r = .35-.52), convergent/discriminant validity, and explained additional variance in mental health measures beyond other psychosocial constructs. Both the 15- and 6-item MAAS scales displayed at least partial factorial invariance across gender. The findings suggest that the MAAS is a sound measure of trait mindfulness among Chinese adolescents. To reduce respondent burden, the MAAS 6-item short-scale provides an option to measure trait mindfulness.},

The SMQ is a 16-item instrument measuring mindful awareness of distressing thoughts, images, and perceptions, developed originally within the mindfulness for psychosis field.                                         Methods                                Overall, three studies were conducted, comprising (1) a non-clinical sample of                 n                 \,=\,848 (638 community sample and 210 meditators); (2) a clinical sample of                 n                 \,=\,213 (106 schizophrenia and 107 depression); and (3) a clinical sample with                 n                 \,=\,122 participants with emotional disorders within a randomized controlled study, of which 30 participants were also included in study 2. To assess convergent validity, participants completed the SMQ, Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI), and Comprehensive Inventory of Mindfulness Experiences (CHIME). To measure divergent validity, participants completed the Brief Symptom Inventory 18 (BSI-18), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Brief Experiential Avoidance Questionnaires (BEAQ), and Anxiety Sensitivity Index 3 (ASI-3).                                                        Results                                Mean internal consistency (α\,=\,0.89) and convergent (                 r                 \,=\,0.66 to 0.73) and divergent validity (                 r                 \,=\,−\,0.09 to −\,0.50) were established and sensitivity to change over time following treatment (                 d                 \,=\,0.86) was shown. For the clinical sample, a single-factor structure is suggested by principal component analysis.                                                        Conclusions               Results provide first evidence for the utility of the German version of the SMQ for clinical practice and research in healthy individuals, meditators, and clinical groups. Further research is needed to examine the underlying construct of mindfulness.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in therapies that include the learning of mindfulness skills. The 39-item Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) has been developed as a reliable and valid comprehensive instrument for assessing different aspects of mindfulness in community and student samples. In this study, the psychometric properties of the Dutch FFMQ were assessed in a sample of 376 adults with clinically relevant symptoms of depression and anxiety. Construct validity was examined with confirmatory factor analyses and by relating the FFMQ to measures of psychological symptoms, well-being, experiential avoidance, and the personality factors neuroticism and openness to experience. In addition, a 24-item short form of the FFMQ (FFMQ-SF) was developed and assessed in the same sample and cross-validated in an independent sample of patients with fibromyalgia. Confirmatory factor analyses showed acceptable model fit for a correlated five-factor structure of the FFMQ and good model fit for the structure of the FFMQ-SF. The replicability of the five-factor structure of the FFMQ-SF was confirmed in the fibromyalgia sample. Both instruments proved highly sensitive to change. It is concluded that both the FFMQ and the FFMQ-SF are reliable and valid instruments for use in adults with clinically relevant symptoms of depression and anxiety.},

  abstract = {Many collective human activities, including violence, have been shown to exhibit universal patterns. The size distributions of casualties both in whole wars from 1816 to 1980 and terrorist attacks have separately been shown to follow approximate power-law distributions. However, the possibility of universal patterns ranging across wars in the size distribution or timing of within-conflict events has barely been explored. Here we show that the sizes and timing of violent events within different insurgent conflicts exhibit remarkable similarities. We propose a unified model of human insurgency that reproduces these commonalities, and explains conflict-specific variations quantitatively in terms of underlying rules of engagement. Our model treats each insurgent population as an ecology of dynamically evolving, self-organized groups following common decision-making processes. Our model is consistent with several recent hypotheses about modern insurgency, is robust to many generalizations, and establishes a quantitative connection between human insurgency, global terrorism and ecology. Its similarity to financial market models provides a surprising link between violent and non-violent forms of human behaviour.},

  abstract = {AIM This paper presents a discussion of the conceptual and practical relationships between the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health and the NANDA-International Taxonomy II for nursing diagnoses, and their use in nursing practice. BACKGROUND The ICF provides a common classification framework for all healthcare professionals, including nurses. Nursing care plans can be broadly based on NANDA-I taxonomies. No published attempt has been made to systematically compare the NANDA-I Taxonomy II to the ICF. DATA SOURCES The most recently published descriptions of both classifications and a case example presenting the combined use of both classifications. The work was carried out in 2009. DISCUSSION There are conceptual commonalities and differences between the ICF and the NANDA-I Taxonomy II. In the case example, the overlap between the ICF categories and NANDA-I nursing diagnoses reflects the fact that the ICF, focusing on functioning and disability, and the NANDA-I Taxonomy II, with its functioning health patterns, are similar in their approaches. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING The NANDA-I Taxonomy II permits the fulfilment of requirements that are exclusively nursing issues. The application of the ICF is useful for nurses to communicate nursing issues with other healthcare professionals in a common language. For nurses, knowledge shared with other healthcare professionals may contribute to broader understanding of a patient's situation. CONCLUSION The ICF and the NANDA-I Taxonomy II should be used in concert by nurses and can complement each other to enhance the quality of clinical team work and nursing practice.},

This conception is shown to diverge from current validity theory in several respects. In particular, the emphasis in the proposed conception is on ontology, reference, and causality, whereas current validity theory focuses on epistemology, meaning, and correlation. It is argued that the proposed conception is not only simpler but also theoretically superior to the position taken in the existing literature. Further, it has clear theoretical and practical implications for validation research. Most important, validation research must not be directed at the relation between the measured attribute and other attributes but at the processes that convey the effect of the measured attribute on the test scores.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, practitioners extensively apply quick and reliable scales of user satisfaction as part of their user experience analyses to obtain well-founded measures of user satisfaction within time and budget constraints. However, in the human–computer interaction literature the relationship between the outcomes of standardized satisfaction scales and the amount of product usage has been only marginally explored. The few studies that have investigated this relationship have typically shown that users who have interacted more with a product have higher satisfaction. The purpose of this article was to systematically analyze the variation in outcomes of three standardized user satisfaction scales (SUS, UMUX, UMUX-LITE) when completed by users who had spent different amounts of time with a website. In two studies, the amount of interaction was manipulated to assess its effect on user satisfaction. Measurements of the three scales were strongly correlated and their outcomes were significantly affected by the amount of interaction time. Notably, the SUS acted as a unidimensional scale when administered to people who had less product experience but was bidimensional when administered to users with more experience. Previous findings of similar magnitudes for the SUS and UMUX-LITE (after adjustment) were replicated but did not show the previously reported similarities of magnitude for the SUS and the UMUX. Results strongly encourage further research to analyze the relationships of the three scales with levels of product exposure. Recommendations for practitioners and researchers in the use of the questionnaires are also provided.}

  abstract = {Effect size information is essential for the scientific enterprise and plays an increasingly central role in the scientific process. We extracted 147,328 correlations and developed a hierarchical taxonomy of variables reported in Journal of Applied Psychology and Personnel Psychology from 1980 to 2010 to produce empirical effect size benchmarks at the omnibus level, for 20 common research domains, and for an even finer grained level of generality. Results indicate that the usual interpretation and classification of effect sizes as small, medium, and large bear almost no resemblance to findings in the field, because distributions of effect sizes exhibit tertile partitions at values approximately one-half to one-third those intuited by Cohen (1988). Our results offer information that can be used for research planning and design purposes, such as producing better informed non-nil hypotheses and estimating statistical power and planning sample size accordingly. We also offer information useful for understanding the relative importance of the effect sizes found in a particular study in relationship to others and which research domains have advanced more or less, given that larger effect sizes indicate a better understanding of a phenomenon. Also, our study offers information about research domains for which the investigation of moderating effects may be more fruitful and provide information that is likely to facilitate the implementation of Bayesian analysis. Finally, our study offers information that practitioners can use to evaluate the relative effectiveness of various types of interventions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Osteoarthritis is a common chronic disease associated with functional impairments and activity limitations, as well as participation restrictions. The Comprehensive International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) Core Set for Osteoarthritis is an application of the ICF and represents the typical spectrum of problems in functioning of patients with osteoarthritis. OBJECTIVE To validate the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for Osteoarthritis from the perspective of physical therapists. METHODS Physical therapists experienced in the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis were asked about patients' problems, resources and aspects of the environmental factors treated by physical therapists in patients with osteoarthritis in a three-round, electronic-mail survey using the Delphi technique. Responses were linked to the ICF. RESULTS Seventy-two experts from 22 countries named 744 meaningful concepts that covered all ICF components. One hundred and fifty-two ICF categories were linked to these answers, 32 concepts were linked to the not-yet-developed personal factors component, and 14 issues were not covered by a single ICF category. Twelve ICF categories were not represented in the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for Osteoarthritis, although at least 75\% of the participants rated them as important. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The content validity of the ICF was widely supported by the physical therapists. However, several issues were raised that were not covered and need to be investigated further.}

Although the instrument is extremely popular in applied settings, there is an urgent need for the development of valid and comprehensive local norms, in order to increase its predictive validity and utility within the Australian context. In addition, there are a number of psychometric limitations pertaining to the reliability and validity of the MBTI, which raise concerns about its use by practitioners. In view of these serious limitations, routine use of the MBTI is not recommended, and psychologists should be cautious as to its likely misuse in various organisational and occupational settings.},

  abstract = {The use of mindfulness training for increasing psychological well-being in a variety of clinical and nonclinical populations has exploded over the last decade. In the area of stuttering, it has been widely recognized that effective long-term management often necessitates treatment of cognitive and affective dimensions of the disorder in addition to behavioral components. Yet, mindfulness based strategies and their possible usefulness in stuttering management have not been described in detail in the literature. This article seeks to engage professionals who treat stuttering in a conversation about the possible usefulness of incorporating mindfulness training into stuttering management. A review of the literature reveals that there is a substantial overlap between what is required for effective stuttering management and the benefits provided by mindfulness practices. Mindfulness practice results in decreased avoidance, increased emotional regulation, and acceptance in addition to improved sensory-perceptual processing and attentional regulation skills. These skills are important for successful long-term stuttering management on both psychosocial and sensory-motor levels. It is concluded that the integration of mindfulness training and stuttering treatment appears practical and worthy of exploration. Mindfulness strategies adapted for people who stutter may help in the management of cognitive, affective, and behavioral challenges associated with stuttering. Educational objectives: Readers should be able to: (1) describe what mindfulness is and how it is cultivated; (2) identify the benefits that can be produced from mindfulness practice; (3) summarize how the benefits of mindfulness practice parallel what is often required for effective long-term stuttering management; and (4) identify specific mindfulness techniques that can be taught in stuttering therapy and explain their rationale.},

In Experiment 1, subjects rated the pleasure and arousal elicited when listening to each of 60 sounds, followed by an incidental free recall task. The shape of the two-dimensional affective space defined by the mean ratings for each sound was similar to that previously obtained for pictures, and, like memory for pictures, free recall was highest for emotionally arousing stimuli. In Experiment 2, autonomic and facial electromyographic (EMG) activity were recorded while a new group of subjects listened to the same set of sounds; the startle reflex was measured using visual probes. Listening to unpleasant sounds resulted in larger startle reflexes, more corrugator EMG activity, and larger heart rate deceleration compared with listening to pleasant sounds. Electrodermal reactions were larger for emotionally arousing than for neutral materials. Taken together, the data suggest that acoustic cues activate the appetitive and defensive motivational circuits underlying emotional expression in ways similar to pictures.},

Autonomic activity (heart rate and skin conductance) was concurrently measured to determine whether pupillary changes are mediated by parasympathetic or sympathetic activation. Following an initial light reflex, pupillary changes were larger when viewing emotionally arousing pictures, regardless of whether these were pleasant or unpleasant. Pupillary changes during picture viewing covaried with skin conductance change, supporting the interpretation that sympathetic nervous system activity modulates these changes in the context of affective picture viewing. Taken together, the data provide strong support for the hypothesis that the pupil's response during affective picture viewing reflects emotional arousal associated with increased sympathetic activity.},

  abstract = {Background:             Existing analyses of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) against COVID19 transmission have concentrated on the joint effectiveness of large-scale NPIs. With increasing data, we can move beyond estimating joint effects towards disentangling individual effects. In addition to effectiveness, policy decisions ought to account for the burden placed by different NPIs on the population.             Methods:             To our knowledge, this is the largest data-driven study of NPI effectiveness to date. We collected chronological data on 9 NPIs in 41 countries between January and April 2020, using extensive fact-checking to ensure high data quality. We infer NPI effectiveness with a novel semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model, modelling both confirmed cases and deaths to increase the signal from which NPI effects can be inferred. Finally, we study how much perceived burden different NPIs impose on the population with an online survey of preferences using the MaxDiff method.             Results:             Eight NPIs have a {$>$}95\% posterior probability of being effective: closing schools (mean reduction in R: 50\%; 95\% credible interval: 39\%-59\%), closing nonessential businesses (34\%; 16\%-49\%), closing high-risk businesses (26\%; 8\%-42\%), and limiting gatherings to 10 people or less (28\%; 8\%-45\%), to 100 people or less (17\%; -3\%-35\%), to 1000 people or less (16\%; -2\%-31\%), issuing stay-at-home orders (14\%; -2\%-29\%), and testing patients with respiratory symptoms (13\%; -1\%-26\%). As validation is crucial for NPI models, we performed 15 sensitivity analyses and evaluated predictions on unseen data, finding strong support for our results. We combine the effectiveness and preference results to estimate effectiveness-to-burden ratios.             Conclusions:             Our results suggest a surprisingly large role for schools in COVID-19 transmission, a contribution to the ongoing debate about the relevance of asymptomatic carriers in disease spreading. We identify additional interventions with good effectiveness-burden tradeoffs, namely symptomatic testing, closing high-risk businesses, and limiting gathering size. Closing most nonessential businesses and issuing stay-at-home orders impose a high burden while having a limited additional effect.},

  abstract = {Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple versions of a predictor and using these to get an aggregated predictor. The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy. 1.

  abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Freund and Schapire[1996]), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

The possible mechanisms of action and active ingredients of psychotherapy in children and adolescents are discussed, with an emphasis on the above-noted domains. The adult psychotherapy literature strongly supports the central roles of the therapeutic relationship and therapeutic empathy; this has been much less intensively explored in the child and adolescent psychotherapy literature. Similarly, there have been few studies examining the mediation of treatment effects by impact on specific domains. Ideally, treatment studies should gather data that can be informative about the impact of putative mediating and moderating psychosocial and biological variables on outcome and course. The results of such studies can aid further refinements in both theories of etiology and improvement in treatments for children and adolescents.},

To fill this gap, the Game Engagement Questionnaire (GEQ) was developed using both classical and Rasch analyses. In Study 1 Rasch analyses provide support for the reliability and functionality of the GEQ scores. Rasch analyses also demonstrate that the GEQ has adequate separation, fit, rating scale functioning, and dimensionality, suggesting that one's tendency to become engaged in video game-playing is a quantifiable construct. In Study 2, behavioral and questionnaire data supported the reliability and validity of the GEQ for predicting engagement in violent video games. The GEQ provides a psychometrically strong measure of levels of engagement specifically elicited while playing video games, and thus shows promise for future research examining risk and protective factors for negative game impact.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Mindfulness is an attribute of consciousness long believed to promote well-being. This research provides a theoretical and empirical examination of the role of mindfulness in psychological well-being. The development and psychometric properties of the dispositional Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) are described. Correlational, quasi-experimental, and laboratory studies then show that the MAAS measures a unique quality of consciousness that is related to a variety of well-being constructs, that differentiates mindfulness practitioners from others, and that is associated with enhanced self-awareness. An experience-sampling study shows that both dispositional and state mindfulness predict self-regulated behavior and positive emotional states. Finally, a clinical intervention study with cancer patients demonstrates that increases in mindfulness over time relate to declines in mood disturbance and stress.},

The present studies were designed to validate among adolescents a measure of mindfulness previously validated for adults (e.g., Brown \& Ryan, 2003), which we herein call the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale-Adolescent (MAAS-A). In 2 large samples of healthy 14- to 18-year-olds (N = 595), Study 1 supported a single-factor MAAS-A structure, along with acceptably high internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and both concurrent and incremental validity. In Study 2, with a sample of 102 psychiatric outpatient adolescents age 14-18 years, participants randomized to a mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention showed significant increases in MAAS-A scores from baseline to 3-month follow-up, relative to nonsignificant score changes among treatment-as-usual participants. Increases in MAAS-A scores among mindfulness-based stress reduction participants were significantly related to beneficial changes in numerous mental health indicators. The findings support the reliability and validity of the MAAS-A in normative and mixed psychiatric adolescent populations and suggest that the MAAS-A has utility in mindfulness intervention research.},

  abstract = {Psychologists routinely treat psychological attributes as quantitative in nature, and the majority of statistical tools traditionally employed by psychologists also rest upon the assumption of continuous quantitative structure. There is no evidence, however, that attributes such as intelligence, depression, personality traits, etc. are truly quantitative, thus rendering most statistical techniques inappropriate for psychological data. Observation Oriented Modeling (OOM) is an alternative data analysis technique that does not require the assumption of continuous quantity, and it is an approach that eschews aggregate statistics while returning individual observations to the forefront of the analysis. Two published mediation models are re-analyzed in the current paper using OOM and the results compared to those obtained from traditional, variable-based analyses. It is shown that OOM yields results that are entirely transparent and readily interpretable. Unlike traditional analyses, the results also provide a clear understanding of what is happening at the level of the persons in the two studies. OOM is therefore a novel way of conceptualizing and analyzing data that may lead to more accurate and complete explanations of psychological phenomena.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Disease Damage Index (SLICC/ACR-DI) item weightings that improve the ability of the measure to predict patient mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Disease damage was measured for 738 patients followed at the University of Toronto Lupus Clinic since diagnosis. Using Rasch analysis, item weightings were determined and tested for their ability to predict death in a logistic regression model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were produced to compare the original and weighted scales' ability to discriminate patients that died during the followup period from those who remained alive. RESULTS: The average SLICC/ACR-DI score per patient was 1.66. In total, 138 of the patients died during a mean followup of 9.2 years. A Rasch analysis derived weighting scheme using weighted domain scores (SLICC/ACR-DI-weighted) was the best weighted scale, with item reliability = 94\%, model mean square infit = 1.01 (STD = 0.05); model mean square outfit = 0.99 (STD = 0.3), separation 4.08. The SLICC/ACR-DI-weighted was modestly better than the SLICC/ACR-DI in discriminating patients who died from those who remained alive. Using standardized scores for comparability, the SLICC/ACR-DI-weighted was better in predicting patient death than the unweighted SLICC/ACR-DI [OR(death)(SLICC/ACR-DI-weighted) = 1.7 vs OR(death)(SLICC-ACR-DI) = 1.4; p {$<$} 0.005]. ROC curve analysis supports that the SLICC/ACR-DI-weighted was somewhat superior to the SLICC/ACR-DI for predicting mortality. CONCLUSION: In this test set, the SLICC/ACR-DI-weighted was modestly better in predicting death than the traditional unweighted SLICC/ACR-DI. However, the SLICC/ACR-DI-weighted is more difficult to apply and the weightings appear not to have provided a clinically relevant improvement of the SLICC-ACR-DI.}

  abstract = {Novelty-seeking tendencies in adolescents may promote innovation as well as problematic impulsive behaviour, including drug abuse. Previous research has not clarified whether neural hyper- or hypo-responsiveness to anticipated rewards promotes vulnerability in these individuals. Here we use a longitudinal design to track 144 novelty-seeking adolescents at age 14 and 16 to determine whether neural activity in response to anticipated rewards predicts problematic drug use. We find that diminished BOLD activity in mesolimbic (ventral striatal and midbrain) and prefrontal cortical (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) regions during reward anticipation at age 14 predicts problematic drug use at age 16. Lower psychometric conscientiousness and steeper discounting of future rewards at age 14 also predicts problematic drug use at age 16, but the neural responses independently predict more variance than psychometric measures. Together, these findings suggest that diminished neural responses to anticipated rewards in novelty-seeking adolescents may increase vulnerability to future problematic drug use.},

  abstract = {Mindfulness meditation research has in recent years become a burgeoning field of investigation, particularly related to treatment of health-related disorders. Nevertheless, the construct of mindfulness has not yet been subjected to scientific validation. The aim of this study has been the empirical analysis of the Buddhist concept of mindfulness and the construction of a measurement scale that operationalizes the construct. The stages of development of a self-evaluative mindfulness inventory are presented in three phases: 1. construction of a pool of items, 2. expert assessment of items, and 3. validation by means of a study in which a preliminary form of a questionnaire was given to four samples of individuals participating in insight meditation retreats; a pre-retreat (n=100), post-retreat (n=93) design was employed. Cronbach alpha reliability coefficients of the 30-item final questionnaire were 0.91 before the course and 0.94 after. For each time of inventory completion, a four-factor solution was found using principal components factor analysis. Factor structure was only moderately stable over time. The four factors primarily reflected the theoretical and conceptual characteristics of mindfulness. Our data indicates one-dimensionality of the construct and the presence of a general factor. The mindfulness inventory provides an economic, valid, homogeneous and reliable instrument, which could be optimized and employed in further research studies.}

In a population-based sample of adults aged 60-96 years (n = 409), leg strength was measured in four muscle groups (knee extensor, knee flexor, ankle plantar flexor, ankle dorsiflexor) of both legs using an isokinetic dynamometer. A leg strength score was calculated as the sum of the four strength measurements in the right leg. Usual gait speed was measured over a 15.2 metre course. With a linear model, leg strength explained 17\% of the variance in gait speed. Non-linear models (quadratic and inverse) explained significantly more variance (22\%). The nature of the non-linear relationship was that, in stronger subjects, there was no association between strength and gait speed, while in weaker subjects, there was an association. Body weight and age also explained significant amounts of variance in gait speed, while sex and height did not. The results supported the hypothesis of a non-linear relationship between leg strength and gait speed that is similar for older men and women. This finding represents a mechanism for how small changes in physiological capacity may have substantial effects on performance in frail adults, while large changes in capacity have little or no effect in healthy adults.},

  abstract = {Das Projekt Conditions and Consequences of Classroom Assessment wird im Rahmen des DFG-Schwerpunktprogramms „Kompetenzmodelle“ durchgeführt und soll der Frage nachgehen, wie diagnostische Information durch schulische Akteure genutzt wird. Das übergeordnete Ziel des Projekts besteht darin zu untersuchen, wie formative Leistungsmessung im Mathematikunterricht gestaltet werden sollte, um sowohl eine präzise und detaillierte Leistungsmessung zu ermöglichen als auch positive Wirkungen auf den auf die Leistungsmessung folgenden Lernprozess von Schülerinnen und Schülern zu erreichen. Dazu wurde u.a. ein Laborexperiment durchgeführt, in welchem die Wirkung unterschiedlicher Arten von Feedback (kriteriales, sozialvergleichendes, prozessbezogenes) auf motivationale und (meta-) kognitive Merkmale von Realschüler(inne)n (N=330) untersucht wurde. Das vorliegende Skalenhandbuch beinhaltet die Dokumentation der eingesetzten Befragungsinstrumente. Motivationale und metakognitive Variablen wurden durch insgesamt vier Schülerfragebögen erhoben; in einem Lehrerfragebogen wurde darüber hinaus die im Mathematikunterricht realisierte Leistungsbeurteilungs- und Rückmeldepraxis der Mathematiklehrkräfte (N=41) erfasst.

Das Verfahren: Der SF-36 ist ein krankheitsübergreifendes Messinstrument zur Erfassung der gesundheitsbezogenen Lebensqualität von Patienten, welcher aus 36 Items besteht. Er erfasst acht Dimensionen der subjektiven Gesundheit: Körperliche Funktionsfähigkeit, Körperliche Rollenfunktion, Körperliche Schmerzen, Allgemeine Gesundheitswahrnehmung, Vitalität, Soziale Funktionsfähigkeit, Emotionale Rollenfunktion und Psychisches Wohlbefinden, die sich den Grunddimensionen Körperliche und Psychische Gesundheit zuordnen lassen. Mit einem Einzelitem wird zusätzlich der aktuelle Gesundheitszustand im Vergleich zum vergangenen Jahr erfragt. Mit dem SF-12 steht eine ökonomische Kurzform zur Verfügung. Sowohl SF-36 als auch SF-12 liegen in jeweils sechs Versionen vor: Die Akutversion bezieht sich auf die vergangene Woche und die Standardversion auf die vergangenen vier Wochen. Beide Versionen können als Fragebogen oder als Interview durchgeführt werden, wobei jeweils zwischen Selbstbeurteilung und Fremdbeurteilung gewählt werden kann. Dem Manual liegt eine CD-ROM bei. Diese enthält die Rohdaten der deutschen Normstichprobe aus dem Jahre 1994 sowie Eingabe- und Syntaxdateien für die Auswertung mit SPSS oder SAS, für deren Benutzung auf dem Computer SPSS oder SAS installiert sein muss. Für die 2., ergänzte und überarbeitete Auflage des SF-36 wurden die Normwerte vollständig neu berechnet. Dabei wurde auf eine entsprechende Alters- und Regionalgewichtung Rücksicht genommen. In allen Normtabellen wurden die Werte der beiden Summenskalen neu integriert. Es wurden zusätzliche, ausführliche Hinweise für die Auswertung in das Manual aufgenommen. Erstmalig ist die Auswertung per Hand mit einem Auswertungsbogen möglich. Zuverlässigkeit: Die internen Konsistenzen (Cronbachs Alpha) der Subskalen liegen in verschiedenen Stichproben mehrheitlich deutlich über .70. Einzig die Subskalen Allgemeine Gesundheitswahrnehmung und Soziale Funktionsfähigkeit lagen in einigen Stichproben zwischen α = .57 und α = .69. Gültigkeit: Es werden umfangreiche Studien zur konvergenten, diskriminanten Validität und Sensitivität des Verfahrens angeführt. Normen: Es liegen Normdaten für Deutschland aus der repräsentativen Bevölkerungsstichprobe von 1994 (N = 2.914), aus dem Bundesgesundheitssurvey von 1998 (N = 6.967) sowie nur für den SF-12 für Österreich aus der Steirischen Gesundheitsbefragung von 1999 (N = 5.169) vor. Weiterhin stehen umfangreiche Vergleichsdaten für verschiedene Patientengruppen zur Verfügung. Bearbeitungsdauer: Etwa 10 Minuten für den Gesamtfragebogen SF-36 und 2 Minuten für die Kurzform SF-12. In 2., ergänzter und überarbeiteter Auflage seit 2011 lieferbar.}

Seventy adults participated in a replication of Milgram's Experiment 5 up to the point at which they first heard the learner's verbal protest (150 volts). Because 79\% of Milgram's participants who went past this point continued to the end of the shock generator's range, reasonable estimates could be made about what the present participants would have done if allowed to continue. Obedience rates in the 2006 replication were only slightly lower than those Milgram found 45 years earlier. Contrary to expectation, participants who saw a confederate refuse the experimenter's instructions obeyed as often as those who saw no model. Men and women did not differ in their rates of obedience, but there was some evidence that individual differences in empathic concern and desire for control affected participants' responses.},

Derived from a central exercise of mindfulness-based interventions, 42 undergraduates were asked to observe their breath for about 18~min. Within this time period, they were prompted 22 times at irregular intervals to indicate whether they had lost mindful contact with their breath as a result of mind wandering. The results show negative correlations between the degree of the ability to stay mindfully in contact with the breath and measures of rumination, repetitive negative thinking, and depression. Moreover, positive associations with self-report data of mindfulness and a negative relationship to fear of bodily sensations support the construct validity of our new approach for the assessment of mindfulness. In summary, findings suggest the healthy quality of mindful breathing regarding depression-related processes.},

Improving technologies with respect to wellbeing requires nuanced understanding of this impact and reliable ways to measure it. Here, we aim to further this understanding by investigating the relations between psychological needs and people's evaluations of technologies (with respect to satisfaction, usability, and measures of value).MethodAcross two studies with 1,521 participants, we improved and validated four scales that were first put forward as part of the METUX model of technology interaction. These scales measure psychological needs in the life, behavior, task, and interface spheres of experience. We applied these scales to four separate technologies (Facebook, TikTok, Blackboard, and Moodle), and examined the relationships between people's need satisfaction and frustration in the four spheres of experience and their overall evaluations of the technologies.Results and discussionEach of the four scales had good psychometric properties across the four technologies. For each sphere of experience, psychological need satisfaction and frustration were associated with standard measures of usability and user satisfaction, and correlation patterns supported the METUX model and its approach to differentiating spheres of technology experience.}

The aim of the current study was to test for brain regions uniquely associated with positive functioning in the context of adversity, using detailed phenotypic classification. METHODS 1,870 European adolescents (Mage = 14.56 years, SDage = 0.44 years, 51.5\% female) underwent MRI scanning and completed behavioral and psychological measures of stressful life events, academic competence, social competence, rule-abiding conduct, personality, and alcohol use. RESULTS The interaction of competence and adversity identified two regions centered on the right middle and superior frontal gyri; grey matter volumes in these regions were larger in adolescents experiencing adversity who showed positive adaptation. Differences in these regions among competence/adversity subgroups were maintained after controlling for several covariates and were robust to alternative operationalization decisions for key constructs. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate structural brain correlates of adolescent resilience, and suggest that right prefrontal structures are implicated in adaptive functioning for youth who have experienced adversity.},

In 2 studies, both simple self-esteem and narcissism were measured, and then individual participants were given an opportunity to aggress against someone who had insulted them or praised them or against an innocent third person. Self-esteem proved irrelevant to aggression. The combination of narcissism and insult led to exceptionally high levels of aggression toward the source of the insult. Neither form of self-regard affected displaced aggression, which was low in general. These findings contradict the popular view that low self-esteem causes aggression and point instead toward threatened egotism as an important cause.},

In Study 2 (N = 100) we replicated the sex differences and consensual ordering of mate preferences found in Study I, using a different methodology and a differently composed sample. Lastly, we present alternative hypotheses to account for the replicated sex differences in preferences for attractiveness and earning potentia},

In this target article, I outline the fundamental premises of evolutionary psychology; illustrate the application of evolutionary psychology to domains such as reasoning, social exchange, language, aggression, jealousy, sex, and status; and then consider the implications of evolutionary psychology for the key branches of social, personality, developmental, and cognitive psychology and suggest ways in which these disciplinary boundaries can be transcended. I conclude by looking at the emergence of evolutionary psychology as our field matures into the 21st century.},

A high level of confusion about these methods can be observed among students, researchers and even professional statisticians. How can a constructivist view of mathematical models and reality help to resolve the confusion? Method: Considerations about the foundations of statistics and probability are revisited with a constructivist attitude that explores which ways of thinking about the modelled phenomena are implied by different approaches to probability modelling. Results: The understanding of the implications of probability modelling for the quantification of evidence can be strongly improved by accepting that whether models are “true” or not cannot be checked from the data, and the use of the models should rather be justified and critically discussed in terms of their implications for the thinking and communication of researchers. Implications: Some useful questions that researchers can use as guidelines when deciding which approach and which model to choose are listed in the paper, along with some implications of using frequentist p-values or Bayesian posterior probability, which can help to address the questions. It is the -- far too often ignored -- responsibility of the researchers to decide which model is chosen and what the evidence suggests rather than letting the results decide themselves in an “objective way.”},

Electroencephalographic measures indicate an overall slowing subsequent to meditation, with theta and alpha activation related to proficiency of practice. Sensory evoked potential assessment of concentrative meditation yields amplitude and latency changes for some components and practices. Cognitive event-related potential evaluation of meditation implies that practice changes attentional allocation. Neuroimaging studies indicate increased regional cerebral blood flow measures during meditation. Taken together, meditation appears to reflect changes in anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal areas. Neurophysiological meditative state and trait effects are variable but are beginning to demonstrate consistent outcomes for research and clinical applications. Psychological and clinical effects of meditation are summarized, integrated, and discussed with respect to neuroimaging data.},

  abstract = {A three-stimulus auditory oddball series was presented to experienced Vipassana meditators during meditation and a control thought period to elicit event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in the two different mental states. The stimuli consisted of a frequent standard tone (500 Hz), an infrequent oddball tone (1000 Hz), and an infrequent distracter (white noise), with all stimuli passively presented through headphones and no task imposed. The strongest meditation compared to control state effects occurred for the distracter stimuli: N1 amplitude from the distracter was reduced frontally during meditation; P2 amplitude from both the distracter and oddball stimuli were somewhat reduced during meditation; P3a amplitude from the distracter was reduced during meditation. The meditation-induced reduction in P3a amplitude was strongest in participants reporting more hours of daily meditation practice and was not evident in participants reporting drowsiness during their experimental meditative session. The findings suggest that meditation state can decrease the amplitude of neurophysiologic processes that subserve attentional engagement elicited by unexpected and distracting stimuli. Consistent with the aim of Vipassana meditation to reduce cognitive and emotional reactivity, the state effect of reduced P3a amplitude to distracting stimuli reflects decreased automated reactivity and evaluative processing of task irrelevant attention-demanding stimuli.},

Meditation state dynamics were measured with spectral decomposition of the last 6 min of the eyes-closed silent meditation compared to control state. Meditation was associated with a decrease in frontal delta (1-4 Hz) power, especially pronounced in those participants not reporting drowsiness during meditation. Relative increase in frontal theta (4-8 Hz) power was observed during meditation, as well as significantly increased parieto-occipital gamma (35-45 Hz) power, but no other state effects were found for the theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), or beta (12-25 Hz) bands. Alpha power was sensitive to condition order, and more experienced meditators exhibited no tendency toward enhanced alpha during meditation relative to the control task. All participants tended to exhibit decreased alpha in association with reported drowsiness. Cross-experimental session occipital gamma power was the greatest in meditators with a daily practice of 10+ years, and the meditation-related gamma power increase was similarly the strongest in such advanced practitioners. The findings suggest that long-term Vipassana meditation contributes to increased occipital gamma power related to long-term meditational expertise and enhanced sensory awareness.},

  abstract = {Unlike any time before in our lives, we have access to vast amounts of free information. With the right tools, we can start to make sense of all this data to see patterns and trends that would otherwise be invisible to us. By transforming numbers into graphical shapes, we allow readers to understand the stories those numbers hide. In this practical introduction to understanding and using information graphics, you'll learn how to use data visualizations as tools to see beyond lists of numbers and variables and achieve new insights into the complex world around us. Regardless of the kind of data you're working with--business, science, politics, sports, or even your own personal finances--this book will show you how to use statistical charts, maps, and explanation diagrams to spot the stories in the data and learn new things from it. You'll also get to peek into the creative process of some of the world's most talented designers and visual journalists, including Condé Nast Traveler's John Grimwade, National Geographic Magazine's Fernando Baptista, The New York Times' Steve Duenes, The Washington Post's Hannah Fairfield, Hans Rosling of the Gapminder Foundation, Stanford's Geoff McGhee, and European superstars Moritz Stefaner, Jan Willem Tulp, Stefanie Posavec, and Gregor Aisch. The book also includes a DVD-ROM containing over 90 minutes of video lessons that expand on core concepts explained within the book and includes even more inspirational information graphics from the world's leading designers. The first book to offer a broad, hands-on introduction to information graphics and visualization, The Functional Art reveals: * Why data visualization should be thought of as “functional art” rather than fine art * How to use color, type, and other graphic tools to make your information graphics more effective, not just better looking * The science of how our brains perceive and remember information ¿ * Best practices for creating interactive information graphics * A comprehensive look at the creative process behind successful information graphics ¿ * An extensive gallery of inspirational work from the world's top designers and visual artistsOn the DVD-ROM:In this introductory video course on information graphics, Alberto Cairo goes into greater detail with even more visual examples of how to create effective information graphics that function as practical tools for aiding perception. You'll learn how to: incorporate basic design principles in your visualizations, create simple interfaces for interactive graphics, and choose the appropriate type of graphic forms for your data. Cairo also deconstructs successful information graphics from The New York Times and National Geographic magazine with sketches and images not shown in the book.All of Peachpit's eBooks contain the same content as the print edition.

To conduct the cross-mapping process, all identified nursing phenomena were joined, organized and compared according to the ICNP's terms. Of the 51 identified nursing phenomena/diagnoses, 46 (90.2\%) showed exact and partial concordance. The identified nursing phenomena can be used to assist nurses to provide care for clients in family planning services. The ICNP showed to be a comprehensive program, although some terms need to be reviewed and others enhanced.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate potential sources of systematic bias arising in the assessment of doctors' professionalism.DESIGN: Linear regression modelling of cross sectional questionnaire survey data.SETTING: 11 clinical practices in England and Wales. PARTICIPANTS: 1065 non-training grade doctors from various clinical specialties and settings, 17,031 of their colleagues, and 30,333 of their patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Two measures of a doctor's professional performance using patient and colleague questionnaires from the United Kingdom's General Medical Council (GMC). We selected potential predictor variables from the characteristics of the doctors and of their patient and colleague assessors.RESULTS: After we adjusted for characteristics of the doctor as well as characteristics of the patient sample, less favourable scores from patient feedback were independently predicted by doctors having obtained their primary medical degree from any non-European country; doctors practising as a psychiatrist; lower proportions of white patients providing feedback; lower proportions of patients rating their consultation as being very important; and lower proportions of patients reporting that they were seeing their usual doctor. Lower scores from colleague feedback were independently predicted by doctors having obtained their primary medical degree from countries outside the UK and South Asia; currently employed in a locum capacity; working as a general practitioner or psychiatrist; being employed in a staff grade, associate specialist, or other equivalent role; and with a lower proportion of colleagues reporting they had daily or weekly professional contact with the doctor. In fully adjusted models, the doctor's age, sex, and ethnic group were not independent predictors of patient or colleague feedback. Neither the age or sex profiles of the patient or colleague samples were independent predictors of doctors' feedback scores, and nor was the ethnic group of colleague samples. CONCLUSIONS: Caution is necessary when considering patient and colleague feedback regarding doctors' professionalism. Multisource feedback undertaken for revalidation using the GMC patient and colleague questionnaires should, at least initially, be principally formative in nature.},

In the first study (N = 372), the psychometric properties of Positivity Scale (P Scale) were examined in accordance with classical test theory using a large number of college participants. In Study 2, the unidimensionality of the P Scale was corroborated with confirmatory factor analysis in 2 independent samples (N₁ = 322; N₂ = 457). In Study 3, P Scale invariance across sexes and its relations with self-esteem, life satisfaction, optimism, positive negative affect, depression, and the Big Five provided further evidence of the internal and construct validity of the new measure in a large community sample (N = 3,589). In Study 4, test-retest reliability of the P Scale was found in a sample of college students (N = 262) who were readministered the scale after 5 weeks. In Study 5, measurement invariance and construct validity of P Scale were further supported across samples in different countries and cultures, including Italy (N = 689), the United States (N = 1,187), Japan (N = 281), and Spain (N = 302). Psychometric findings across diverse cultural context attest to the robustness of the P Scale and to positivity as a basic disposition.},

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses support a two-factor solution, corresponding to the two constituent components of the construct. Good internal consistency was demonstrated, and relationships with other constructs were largely as expected. As predicted, significant differences were found between the nonclinical and clinical samples in levels of awareness and acceptance. The awareness and acceptance subscales were not correlated, suggesting that these two constructs can be examined independently. Potential theoretical and applied uses of the measure are discussed.},

The research had two main objectives: to contribute to the identification and definition of concepts that represent nursing knowledge in obstetrics and to participate in the validation of the International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP)®. METHODS Using a qualitative approach, the study was designed in three phases. The first phase aimed to identify the terms and expressions used by nurses in nursing documentation and oral report, using document analysis, observation and interview as data collection methods. The second phase intended to determine which terms and expressions corresponded to ICNP® concepts. The third phase aimed to analyse the definition of some ICNP® concepts. In both the second and third phases, a consensus approach was used based on the Delphi Technique. ICNP® concepts were identified from the words and expressions used by nurses and midwives to describe their practice. RESULTS The results of this study suggested modifications on some ICNP® concept definitions, namely burping, bonding, mother-child attachment, infant sucking, false labour pain, aborting, and uterine contraction; and the inclusion of specific characteristics in others, i.e. uterine expulsion, breast engorgement, colic, and hunger. New ICNP® concepts were also suggested, specifically mother-foetal attachment, uterine contraction after labour, pain after labour and foetal well-being. CONCLUSION The study confirmed that ICNP® is an important instrument to identify the concepts needed to describe mother and child needs during the perinatal period.},

There is held to be an asymmetry whereby the societal costs of discussing certain topics inevitably outweigh any benefits from doing so. This paper argues that no such asymmetry has been empirically demonstrated, and that stifling debate around taboo topics can itself do active harm. To the extent that the paper’s argument has force, it cannot simply be taken for granted that, when in doubt, stifling debate around taboo topics is the ethical thing to do.},

The grandiose exhibitionism subscale of the narcissistic personality inventory was hypothesized to predict the self-promoting behaviors. The entitlement/exploitativeness subscale was hypothesized to predict the anti-social behaviors. Results were largely consistent with the hypothesis for the self-promoting behaviors but mixed concerning the anti-social behaviors. Trait self-esteem was also related in the opposite manner as the Narcissism scales to some Facebook behaviors. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Debate has emerged in the literature on mania, with some evidence suggesting that tendencies toward mania relate to negative emotional and cognitive styles, and other evidence suggesting that tendencies toward mania relate to positive emotional and cognitive styles. An initial study examined how tendencies toward mania (as measured by the Hypomanic Personality Scale) and tendencies toward depression (as measured by the Inventory to Diagnose Depression-Lifetime version) were related to diverse measures pertaining to incentive and threat motivations, negative and positive emotionality, and cognitive responses to emotion, among 238 undergraduates. Tendencies toward mania related to a self-reported pattern of reacting intensely to positive stimuli, both cognitively and emotionally, as well as lower sensitivity to threatening stimuli and less restraint over impulses. In contrast, tendencies toward depression related to a pattern of reacting more strongly to negative stimuli emotionally and cognitively, as well as deficits in the ability to savor positive affect. This pattern was re-confirmed in a second sample of 394 undergraduates, who completed many of the same measures plus a measure of current mood symptoms. This second sample confirmed that the pattern was not mood-state dependent. Implications for future research and clinical work are discussed, including an intriguing conceptual parallel in the distinct sets of correlates of depressive versus manic tendencies.},

  abstract = {The study presented in this article examined the impact of two simulation-based inference activities on students’ understanding of p-values in a second undergraduate statistics course. In the study, students familiar with traditional inference methods used physical and computer simulations to estimate p-values. To examine students’ conceptions before and after participation, students were prompted to write brief explanations of p-values, to apply these explanations in different contexts, and to self-evaluate their understanding. This article describes students’ varying conceptions of p-values and the ways in which students demonstrated improvement after engaging in simulation-based inference activities. Qualitative analysis of student responses suggests that students hold a range of conceptions of p-values even after a full semester of instruction; further, this study suggests that incorporating simulation-based inference into traditional courses has the potential to improve understanding of p-values and is a promising area for future research.},

  abstract = {We examined the neural basis of self-regulation in individuals from a cohort of preschoolers who performed the delay-of-gratification task 4 decades ago. Nearly 60 individuals, now in their mid-forties, were tested on "hot" and "cool" versions of a go/nogo task to assess whether delay of gratification in childhood predicts impulse control abilities and sensitivity to alluring cues (happy faces). Individuals who were less able to delay gratification in preschool and consistently showed low self-control abilities in their twenties and thirties performed more poorly than did high delayers when having to suppress a response to a happy face but not to a neutral or fearful face. This finding suggests that sensitivity to environmental hot cues plays a significant role in individuals' ability to suppress actions toward such stimuli. A subset of these participants (n = 26) underwent functional imaging for the first time to test for biased recruitment of frontostriatal circuitry when required to suppress responses to alluring cues. Whereas the prefrontal cortex differentiated between nogo and go trials to a greater extent in high delayers, the ventral striatum showed exaggerated recruitment in low delayers. Thus, resistance to temptation as measured originally by the delay-of-gratification task is a relatively stable individual difference that predicts reliable biases in frontostriatal circuitries that integrate motivational and control processes.},

We included articles that addressed online hate speech or cyberhate between 2015 and 2019. Meta-analysis could not be conducted due to the broad diversity of studies and measure units. The reviewed studies provided exploratory data about the Internet and social media as a space for online hate speech, types of cyberhate, terrorism as online hate trigger, online hate expressions and most common methods to assess online hate speech. As a general consensus on what is cyberhate, this is conceptualized as the use of violent, aggressive or offensive language, focused on a specific group of people who share a common property, which can be religion, race, gender or sex or political affiliation through the use of Internet and Social Networks, based on a power imbalance, which can be carried out repeatedly, systematically and uncontrollably, through digital media and often motivated by ideologies.},

The logistic differential equation, dealt with in the next section, is a classical but still useful model for describing the dynamics of a one-species population in and environment with limited resources. For example, the data in Table 1 and Figure 1 represent the time evolution of an algal sample taken in the Adriatic Sea and do seem to follow a logistic curve. We will explore the problem of fitting, in the least-squares sense, a logistic curve (i.e., the solution to the logistic equation) to such a set of measured data.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Studying the neural consequences of tobacco smoking during adolescence, including those associated with early light use, may help expose the mechanisms that underlie the transition from initial use to nicotine dependence in adulthood. However, only a few studies in adolescents exist, and they include small samples. In addition, the neural mechanism, if one exists, that links nicotinic receptor genes to smoking behavior in adolescents is still unknown. METHODS Structural and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from a large sample of 14-year-old adolescents who completed an extensive battery of neuropsychological, clinical, personality, and drug-use assessments. Additional assessments were conducted at 16 years of age. RESULTS Exposure to smoking in adolescents, even at low doses, is linked to volume changes in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and to altered neuronal connectivity in the corpus callosum. The longitudinal analyses strongly suggest that these effects are not preexisting conditions in those who progress to smoking. There was a genetic contribution wherein the volume reduction effects were magnified in smokers who were carriers of the high-risk genotype of the alpha 5 nicotinic receptor subunit gene, rs16969968. CONCLUSIONS These findings give insight into a mechanism involving genes, brain structure, and connectivity underlying why some adolescents find nicotine especially addictive.}

METHODS: A total of 256 people participated, comprising a non-clinical community sample of 134 (83 meditators and 51 non-meditators) and a clinical sample of 122 people with a current distressing psychosis. To assess concurrent validity, non-clinical participants and half clinical participants (total 197 participants) completed the mindful attention awareness scale (MAAS). Predicted links were assessed with affect, and 59 patients completed a validated measure to assess link between mindfulness and intensity of 'delusional' experience. RESULTS: The scale has a single factor structure, was internally reliable, significantly correlated with the MAAS, showed expected associations with affect, and distinguished among meditators, non-meditators and people with psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: The data support use of the SMQ in clinical practice and research to assess mindful responding to distressing thoughts and images.},

There is, however, evidence for acceptance-based therapy reducing relapse, and some evidence for clinical benefits of mindfulness groups for people with distressing psychosis, though no data on whether participants became more mindful. AIMS: To assess feasibility of randomized evaluation of group mindfulness therapy for psychosis, to replicate clinical gains observed in one small uncontrolled study, and to assess for changes in mindfulness. METHOD: Twenty-two participants with current distressing psychotic experiences were allocated at random between group-based mindfulness training and a waiting list for this therapy. Mindfulness training comprised twice-weekly sessions for 5 weeks, plus home practice (meditation CDs were supplied), followed by 5 weeks of home practice. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between intervention and waiting-list participants. Secondary analyses combining both groups and comparing scores before and after mindfulness training revealed significant improvement in clinical functioning (p = .013) and mindfulness of distressing thoughts and images (p = .037). CONCLUSIONS: Findings on feasibility are encouraging and secondary analyses replicated earlier clinical benefits and showed improved mindfulness of thoughts and images, but not voices.},

Preliminary assessment data have been largely positive. This article describes the analysis of the first year of data from a multi-institution assessment effort by instructors using such an approach in a college-level introductory statistics course, some for the first time. We examine several pre-/post-measures of student attitudes and conceptual understanding of several topics in the introductory course. We highlight some patterns in the data, focusing on student level and instructor level variables and the application of hierarchical modeling to these data. One observation of interest is that the newer instructors see very similar gains to more experienced instructors, but we also look to how the data collection and analysis can be improved for future years, especially the need for more data on “nonusers.”}

As a consequence, students struggle to learn new statistical analyses, in contexts that differ from their textbooks. This paper gives a short introduction to the general linear model (GLM), in which it is showed that ANOVA (one‐way, factorial, repeated measure and analysis of covariance) is simply a multiple correlation/regression analysis (MCRA). Generalizations to other cases, such as multivariate and nonlinear analysis, are also discussed. It can easily be shown that every popular linear analysis can be derived from understanding MCRA}

This paper compares four methods of measuring user cognitive load, that is, subjective rating of task difficulty, task completion time, performance accuracy and eye activity based physiological measurement. In order to be practically useful, the measurement should be sensitive to task difficulty variation and accurately predict user cognitive load. In this study, we examined the sensitivity and accuracy of these measures for five levels of cognitive load. ANOVA tests and Gaussian mixture model classification results show that subjective rating of task difficulty is the most effective measure, meanwhile eye activity based measure is as sensitive and accurate as using task completion time to classify two or more cognitive load levels, but has the relative advantage of being a real time measure and not requiring a specific action.},

A total of 133 Chinese mindfulness practitioners at 20–72 years old were recruited from a 3-day transnational meditation event in Hong Kong. Findings based on structural equation modeling indicated that controlling for sex, age, education, family income, number of hours of mindfulness practice per week, and type of administration, dispositional mindfulness was associated with satisfaction with life through savoring positive experiences and gratitude as mediators. The findings provided initial evidence for these processes between mindfulness and life satisfaction in the Chinese context. To promote life satisfaction, researchers and mental health practitioners should recognize the chain of mechanisms related to mindfulness.}

Design and Methods: An item response theory, Rasch analysis, was conducted with data from a larger study that implemented 3 interventions and collected data at 3 time points (prior to intervention, after intervention, and a year following the end of intervention). Results: A unidimensional structure was found in this study to adequately fit the data. There appears to be significant differential item functioning, with up to one third of the items indicating that the items have different meanings for different groups of participants. As a screening tool, the GDS-SF is more likely to discriminate between older adults who have a ``moderate��? level of depression than between those with mild depression and no diagnosed depression. Implications: We would recommend that the GDS-SF not be used as the sole method of screening for depression but incorporated into other clinical knowledge related to the geriatric patient in question, given that not all items are equally functional. The GDS-SF may be less effective as a screening tool but could be better used to detect a change in moderate levels of depression. Clinicians may also benefit by identifying person responses that misfit. If an individual provides responses that are atypical, the person might be referred to provide a more in-depth assessment of mental health status.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the psychometric validity and reliability of the incident reporting culture questionnaire (IRCQ; in Chinese) following an exploration of the reporting culture perceived by hospital nurses in Taiwan. DESIGN: Scale development with psychometric examination and a cross-sectional study. SETTING: Ten teaching hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1064 nurses participated with an average response rate of 83\% between November 2008 and June 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The factorial construct, criterion-related validity, homogeneity and stability of the IRCQ were evaluated. The nurses' perceptions of the IRCQ were also explored. RESULTS: The four-factor structure of the 20-item IRCQ had satisfactory construct validity (explained variance: 49.37\%), criterion-related validity (r = 0.42; P = 0.001), reliability (Cronbach's alpha: 0.83) and stability (3-week-interval correlation: r = 0.80; P = 0.001). These factors included 'application of learning from errors', 'readiness to provide feedback on incident reports', 'collegial atmospheres of unpleasantness and punishment' (CA) and 'incident management: confidential and system driven'. The nurses perceived a moderate overall reporting culture (mean positive response = 49.25\%; range: 67.2-24.94\%). They weakly agreed on the CA factor of five items (mean positive response = 24.94\%; range: 33.0-17.2\%). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides empirical evidence for the psychometric properties of the IRCQ and the reporting culture which nurses perceive in Taiwan. To Taiwanese nurses, the reporting culture within their work environments especially as it relates to coworker relations, inter-professional collaboration and non-punitive atmosphere is their major concern. Healthcare administrators should consider nurses' perceptions related to incident reporting when managing underreporting issues.},

  abstract = {Mindfulness meditation practices (MMPs) are a subgroup of meditation practices which are receiving growing attention. The present paper reviews current evidence about the effects of MMPs on objective measures of cognitive functions. Five databases were searched. Twenty three studies providing measures of attention, memory, executive functions and further miscellaneous measures of cognition were included. Fifteen were controlled or randomized controlled studies and 8 were case-control studies. Overall, reviewed studies suggested that early phases of mindfulness training, which are more concerned with the development of focused attention, could be associated with significant improvements in selective and executive attention whereas the following phases, which are characterized by an open monitoring of internal and external stimuli, could be mainly associated with improved unfocused sustained attention abilities. Additionally, MMPs could enhance working memory capacity and some executive functions. However, many of the included studies show methodological limitations and negative results have been reported as well, plausibly reflecting differences in study design, study duration and patients' populations. Accordingly, even though findings here reviewed provided preliminary evidence suggesting that MMPs could enhance cognitive functions, available evidence should be considered with caution and further high quality studies investigating more standardized mindfulness meditation programs are needed. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The aim of this article is to review current evidence on the therapeutic efficacy of MBIs for SUM. A literature search was undertaken using four electronic databases and references of retrieved articles. The search included articles written in English published up to December 2011. Quality of included trials was assessed. In total, 24 studies were included, three of which were based on secondary analyses of previously investigated samples. Current evidence suggests that MBIs can reduce the consumption of several substances including alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, marijuana, cigarettes, and opiates to a significantly greater extent than waitlist controls, non-specific educational support groups, and some specific control groups. Some preliminary evidence also suggests that MBIs are associated with a reduction in craving as well as increased mindfulness. The limited generalizability of the reviewed findings is noted (i.e., small sample size, lack of methodological details, and the lack of consistently replicated findings). More rigorous and larger randomized controlled studies are warranted.},

  abstract = {Biomedical journals and the pharmaceutical industry share the goals of enhancing transparency and expanding access to peer-reviewed research; both industries have recently instituted new policies and guidelines to effect this change. However, while increasing transparency may elevate standards and bring benefits to readers, it will drive a significant increase in manuscript volume, posing challenges to both the journals and industry sponsors. As a result, there is a need to: (1) increase efficiency in the submission process to accommodate the rising manuscript volume and reduce the resource demands on journals, peer reviewers, and authors; and (2) identify suitable venues to publish this research. These shared goals can only be accomplished through close collaboration among stakeholders in the process.In an effort to foster mutual collaboration, members of the pharmaceutical industry and the International Society for Medical Publication Professionals founded a unique collaborative venture in 2008 - the Medical Publishing Insights and Practices initiative (MPIP). At an MPIP roundtable meeting in September 2009,journal editors, publishers and industry representatives identified and prioritized opportunities to streamline the submission process and requirements, and to support prompt publication and dissemination of clinical trial results in the face of increasing manuscript volume. Journal and sponsor participants agreed that more author education on manuscript preparation and submission was needed to increase efficiency and enhance quality and transparency in the publication of industry-sponsored research. They suggested an authors'guide to help bridge the gap between author practices and editor expectations.To address this unmet educational need, MPIP supported development of an Authors' Submission Toolkit to compile best practices in the preparation and submission of manuscripts describing sponsored research.The Toolkit represents a unique collaboration between the pharmaceutical industry and biomedical journals,and reflects both groups' perspectives on how authors can help raise standards and increase efficiency in publishing industry-sponsored studies. The information provided in the toolkit can be useful to help authors navigate the manuscript},

Data from 2,262 inpatients obtained over a period of 9 weeks (May to July 2003) were extracted from the EMR system for analysis. Among the 530,218 data-input events, 401,190 (75.7\%) were entered from the NDD, 20,550 (3.9\%) used only free text, and 108,478 (20.4\%) used a combination of coded data and free text. A content analysis of the free-text events showed that 80.3\% of the expressions could be found in the NDD, whereas 10.9\% were context-specific expressions such as direct quotations of patient complaints and responses, and references to the care plan or orders of physicians. A total of 7.8\% of the expressions was used for a supplementary purpose such as adding a conjunction or end verb to make an expression appear as natural language. Only 1.0\% of the expressions were identified as not being covered by the NDD. This evaluation study demonstrates that the ICNP-based NDD has sufficient power to cover most of the expressions used in a clinical nursing setting.},

  abstract = {A study by Jaeggi and her colleagues (2008) claimed that they were able to improve fluid intelligence (gf) by training working memory. Subjects who trained their working memory on a dual n-back task for a period of time showed significant improvements in working memory span tasks and fluid intelligence tests such as the Raven's Progressive Matrices and the Bochumer Matrices Test (BOMAT) after training compared to those without training. The current study aimed to replicate and extend the original study conducted by Jaeggi et al. (2008) in a well-controlled experiment that could explain the cause or causes of such transfer if indeed the case. There were a total of 93 participants who completed the study, and they were randomly assigned to one of three groups---a passive control group, active control group and experimental group. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to the 8-day condition and the other half to the 20-day condition. All participants completed a battery of tests at pre- and post-tests that consisted of short timed tests, a complex working memory span and a matrix reasoning task. Participants in the active control group practiced for either 8 days or 20 days on the same task as the one used in the experimental group, the dual n-back, but at the easiest level to control for Hawthorne effect. Results from the current study did not suggest any significant improvement in the mental abilities tested, especially fluid intelligence and working memory capacity, after training for 8 days or 20 days. This leads to the conclusion that increasing one's working memory capacity by training and practice did not transfer to improvement on fluid intelligence as asserted by Jaeggi and her colleagues (2008, 2010).

There are two major research questions in this study. First, this study tries to find out whether listening to music affect the learner's concentration when they are doing a task such as reading. The second research question is whether light classical music is more distracting or less distracting than hip hop music during a reading comprehension task. An experiment involving 133 participants from a medium-size college in southern Taiwan was conducted where the participants performed a reading comprehension task with either light classical music, hip hop music, or with no music in the background. The result of the study showed that music with a higher intensity is more distracting and has a greater effect on task performance and concentration. The result helped formulate the Attention Drainage Effect theory, which is based on Kahneman's (1973) capacity model of attention. (Contains 2 tables.)},

DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Rehabilitation hospital. SUBJECTS: 117 patients were recruited and 100 (mean age: 68.43 +/- 7.95 years) of them completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients receiving total knee replacement due to knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned into 3 groups of: active stretching (group 1, n =32), passive stretching (group 2, n =35) and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching (group 3, n =33). MAIN MEASURES: The immediate change in both active and passive knee flexion range after the first treatment session and the pattern of change in these ranges throughout the 2-week study period were compared among the three groups. RESULTS: All groups demonstrated significant improvement in knee ranges with time. The active range of group 1 improved by 19.9 degrees , group 2 by 25.3 degrees and group 3 by 22.5 degrees throughout the 2-week period, whereas the improvements in the passive range were 18.8 degrees , 24.5 degrees and 22.7 degrees , respectively. For between-group comparisons, no significant difference was found in both active (P = 0.647) and passive (P = 0.501) knee range immediately after stretching. For the changes at 2 weeks, there was also no significant difference among the groups in both active (P = 0.716) and passive (P = 0.959) knee ranges. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that all three modes of stretching were associated with an increase in the knee flexion range of patients after total knee replacement, with no statistically significant differences between the changes seen.},

We review recent neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and peripheral psychophysiological evidence for emotion and emotion regulation deficits in ADHD across youth and adults. RECENT FINDINGS Central and autonomous nervous system correlates argue in favor of more general self-regulation deficits and also specific emotional deficits in ADHD. These include general performance deficits in executive functions, and structural as well as functional impairments in neuronal networks associated with top-down self-regulation. Specific deficits with bottom-up emotional activation in the amygdala and emotion evaluation associated with the orbitofrontal cortex have also been described. Furthermore, vagally mediated, high-frequency heart rate variability is associated with emotional self-regulation deficits throughout the life span. The current evidence is based on multilevel studies that assess associations of emotion regulation. However, further studies that adequately consider the processual recursive character of emotion generation and regulation may give important new insights into emotional regulation of ADHD. Emotion regulation deficits in ADHD are associated with specific as well as general self-regulation deficits traceable on the level of neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and psychophysiological assessments. The temporal dynamics of the interplay of those different systems need further study in order to optimize and personalize treatment of emotion regulation difficulties, including emotional reactivity, in patients with ADHD.}

SETTING: Flexibility training was performed in participants' homes. Assessments were performed in a biomechanics laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Forty healthy volunteers (mean age +/- SD, 72.1+/-4.7 y) randomized to 2 groups: intervention (n=20) and control (n=20). INTERVENTION: Intervention participants performed an 8-week stretching program, and control group participants maintained activity level for 8 weeks. One investigator made weekly visits to instruct and monitor participants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were passive joint motion for hip extension and ankle dorsiflexion and freely chosen gait speed. Secondary outcome measures were gait parameters during freely chosen gait speed and set gait speed walking (stride length, joint displacement). RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the intervention group had increased combined hip and knee motion (P=.023), ankle motion (P=.020), and freely chosen gait speed (P=.016). The intervention group showed statistically nonsignificant trends of increased stride length at freely chosen gait speed and set gait speed. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest joint motion is a modifiable impairment that is effectively targeted with flexibility training for older people. Participants in the intervention group had improvements in joint motion as well as increased freely chosen gait speed. Mechanisms responsible for changes in freely chosen gait speed warrant further investigation.},

All 3 experiments included a condition in which a requester first asked for an extreme favor (which was refused to him) and then for a smaller favor. In each instance, this procedure produced more compliance with the smaller favor than a procedure in which the requester asked solely for the smaller favor. Additional control conditions in each experiment support the hypothesis that the effect is mediated by a rule for reciprocation of concessions. Several advantages to the use of the rejection-then-moderation procedure for producing compliance are discussed. (15 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Two experiments were conducted in a door-to-door charity drive context with 165 Ss to examine the effectiveness of a technique for solving the dilemma of small requests. In this predicament it has been observed that minimal requests, while serving to make a target person's compliance highly likely, also tend to produce low-level payoffs for the requester. A procedure was developed to avoid the dilemma by legitimizing, rather than requesting, the delivery of a minimal favor. It was predicted that a solicitor who implied that a very small favor was acceptable, but not necessarily desirable, would make it difficult for a target to decline to help and, at the same time, make it unlikely that the target would actually offer a low grade of assistance. In confirmation of this prediction, a door-to-door solicitor for charity was able to increase significantly the frequency of donations while leaving unaffected the size of the donations by adding the sentence, "Even a penny will help," to a standard request for funds. Exp II replicated this result and provided evidence for the legitimization-of-small-favors explanation of the effect.}

An egoistic alternative account of this evidence was proposed and tested in our work. We hypothesized that an observer's heightened empathy for a sufferer brings with it increased personal sadness in the observer and that it is the egoistic desire to relieve the sadness, rather than the selfless desire to relieve the sufferer, that motivates helping. Two experiments contrasted predictions from the selfless and egoistic alternatives in the paradigm typically used by Batson and his associates. In the first, an emphatic orientation to a victim increased personal sadness, as expected. Furthermore, when sadness and empathic emotion were separated experimentally, helping was predicted by the levels of sadness subjects were experiencing but not by their empathy scores. In the second experiment, enhanced sadness was again associated with empathy for a victim. However, subjects who were led to perceive that their moods could not be altered through helping (because of the temporary action of a "mood-fixing" placebo drug) were not helpful, despite high levels of empathic emotion. The results were interpreted as providing support for an egoistically based interpretation of helping under conditions of high empathy.},

In 5 natural settings, focusing Ss on either the descriptive norms or the injunctive norms regarding littering caused the Ss' littering decisions to change only in accord with the dictates of the then more salient type of norm.},

Consequently, instructors teaching a methods course are often left with few supporting examples of published studies employing different research designs to discuss and analyze in class. We designed this resource to support students actively learning methodology in the classroom by providing instructors with an annotated bibliography of contemporary research to illustrate various research design elements in the context of topics that students will find engaging. Instructors can assign these articles as supplementary readings in order to provide a foundation for class discussion, activities, and critical thinking exercises. To facilitate this, each bibliographic entry includes in-class discussions starters that promote critical thinking as well as activities that use the research article as a foundation for developing new research questions and designs. The articles we selected for this resource illustrate various research designs as well as serve as examples of specific design features such as inter-rater reliability, the use of confederates, and other methods utilized in a variety of subject areas (e.g., sensation/perception, health psychology, social psychology, and neuroscience). We have also identified the statistical analyses used in each article so that instructors could use this resource in a statistics course.}

We investigate the theses of “long peace” and drop in violence and find that these are statistically invalid and resulting from flawed and naive methodologies, incompatible with fat tails and non-robust to minor changes in data formatting and methodologies. There is no statistical basis to claim that “times are different” owing to the long inter-arrival times between conflicts; there is no basis to discuss any “trend”, and no scientific basis for narratives about change in risk. We describe naive empiricism under fat tails. We also establish that violence has a “true mean” that is underestimated in the track record.

We used functional MRI to investigate the neural basis by which an interruption is more disruptive to working memory performance in older individuals. Younger and older adults engaged in delayed recognition tasks both with and without interruption by a secondary task. Behavioral analysis revealed that working memory performance was more impaired by interruptions in older compared with younger adults. Functional connectivity analyses showed that when interrupted, older adults disengaged from a memory maintenance network and reallocated attentional resources toward the interrupting stimulus in a manner consistent with younger adults. However, unlike younger individuals, older adults failed to both disengage from the interruption and reestablish functional connections associated with the disrupted memory network. These results suggest that multitasking leads to more significant working memory disruption in older adults because of an interruption recovery failure, manifest as a deficient ability to dynamically switch between functional brain networks.},

  abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events -- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

(2010). Within this past year, the ASA has issued a new and comprehensive set of guidelines for undergraduate programs (ASA 2014). Accepting (and applauding) all this as background, the current article argues the need to rethink our curriculum from the ground up, and offers five principles and two caveats intended to help us along the path toward a new synthesis. These principles and caveats rest on my sense of three parallel evolutions: the convergence of trends in the roles of mathematics, computation, and context within statistics education. These ongoing changes, together with the articles cited above and the seminal provocation by Leo Breiman (2001) call for a deep rethinking of what we teach to undergraduates. In particular, following Brown and Kass, we should put priority on two goals, to make fundamental concepts accessible and to minimize prerequisites to research.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE For healthcare terminologies to provide coverage of a domain, many have evolved into very large and complex sets, creating a challenge for implementation. The International Classification of Nursing Practice (ICNP) Version 2 has over 2800 concepts. Thus, development of terminology subsets is considered as a potential solution to facilitate implementation. METHOD Based on early efforts to develop ICNP Catalogues, or clinically relevant subsets of the terminology, a process model was developed based on the ICNP life cycle. The steps involved in developing a subset are (a) identifying client(s) and health priority, (b) gathering terms and concepts relevant to a given priority, (c) mapping the identified concepts to the ICNP terminology, (d) modeling new concepts, (e) finalizing a Catalogue, and (f) disseminating the Catalogue. RESULTS The ICNP model was applied to subset development resulting in three ICNP Catalogues: (a) Partnering with Patients and Families to Promote Adherence to Treatment, (b) Palliative Care for Dignified Dying, and (c) Canadian Health Outcomes for Better Information and Care. Although the three Catalogues were very different in the focus of health priority addressed, there are overlapping concepts across the Catalogues ranging from 1.0 to 14.2\%. CONCLUSION The ICNP process model for Catalogue development can be used by other terminology developers and potentially assist in the creation of subset of ICNP to be used at the electronic health record interface. Further research is needed to address challenges and implications for testing and applications of terminology subsets.},

Exploratory data analysis and the use of graphic methods, a steady improvement in and a movement toward standardization in measurement, an emphasis on estimating effect sizes using confidence intervals, and the informed use of available statistical methods are suggested.

Here we show that employees of a large, international bank behave, on average, honestly in a control condition. However, when their professional identity as bank employees is rendered salient, a significant proportion of them become dishonest. This effect is specific to bank employees because control experiments with employees from other industries and with students showthat they do not becomemore dishonestwhen theirprofessional identity or bank-related items are rendered salient. Our results thus suggest that the prevailing business culture in the banking industry weakens and undermines the honesty norm, implying that measures to re-establish an honest culture are very important.},

The Judgement Axis, in its present format, consists of an alphabetical listing of terms that are meant to reflect the clinical opinion of a nurse relating to the state of a nursing phenomenon appearing in Axis A of the ICNP beta. A review of literature indicates that judgement can be more extensive. Not considered in the development of the Axis is the fact that judgement can be clinical and actuarial. Actuarial judgement is predictive and based on statistics. Clinical judgement is patient-centred, creative and intuitive. Both are essential in defining nursing judgement. The list presents 49 modifiers in nominal form. Each of these is subordinated, in alphanumeric descending order, by qualifiers that do not conform to the concept of lexical hierarchy. We propose that the 49 terms which appear in the present listing as unique ordinates should be clustered into major categories with synonyms listed as subordinates of the major cluster headings. The qualifiers of degree, which are presently identified as subordinates in Axis B, might be presented in matrix format, providing a scale of degree of the modifier for the nurse.},

A committee of 12 representatives from these organizations worked for several years to prepare 22 guidelines, and later these guidelines were field-tested (see, for example, Hambleton, 2001; Hambleton, Merenda, \& Spielberger, 2005; Hambleton, Yu, \& Slater, 1999; Tanzer \& Sim, 1999). Later, these guidelines were approved by the ITC for distribution to national psychological societies, test publishers, and researchers.},

This has resulted in nursing being neglected as a partner in healthcare because the data nurses collect cannot be easily retrieved from the patient record and is not widely used to support nursing practice. Nurses, as they should, have rejected language classification systems that are inadequate or inappropriate, but with the implementation of electronic health records, consensus on language classification must be achieved. One problem has been finding an appropriate terminology/s that represents the spectrum of nursing practice while making sense to both the user and computer. In 1989 the International Council of Nurses began work to achieve this and the International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP®) was born. This paper provides an insight into language classification, explores the ICNP® as a tool for nursing practice and discusses some of the projects undertaken thus far.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Experimental attempts to test RST are reviewed and the theoretical problems raised by this literature discussed. Also presented are data relating to a recent clarification of RST, viz. the joint subsystems hypothesis, which postulates a fundamental interdependence of appetitive and aversive systems in the typical human laboratory. The value of Gray's general approach to building behavioural theories on the bases of both the conceptual nervous system and the real nervous system is validated in personality, which has long been thought a philosophical mystery rather than a standard problem to be tackled by scientific method.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness is a process whereby one is aware and receptive to present moment experiences. Although mindfulness-enhancing interventions reduce pathological mental and physical health symptoms across a wide variety of conditions and diseases, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown. Converging evidence from the mindfulness and neuroscience literature suggests that labeling affect may be one mechanism for these effects. METHODS: Participants (n = 27) indicated trait levels of mindfulness and then completed an affect labeling task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. The labeling task consisted of matching facial expressions to appropriate affect words (affect labeling) or to gender-appropriate names (gender labeling control task). RESULTS: After controlling for multiple individual difference measures, dispositional mindfulness was associated with greater widespread prefrontal cortical activation, and reduced bilateral amygdala activity during affect labeling, compared with the gender labeling control task. Further, strong negative associations were found between areas of prefrontal cortex and right amygdala responses in participants high in mindfulness but not in participants low in mindfulness. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings with a dispositional measure of mindfulness suggest one potential neurocognitive mechanism for understanding how mindfulness meditation interventions reduce negative affect and improve health outcomes, showing that mindfulness is associated with enhanced prefrontal cortical regulation of affect through labeling of negative affective stimuli.},

The primary outcome was circulating counts of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Participants in the 1-day control seminar showed declines in CD4+ T lymphocyte counts whereas counts among participants in the 8-week MBSR program were unchanged from baseline to post-intervention (time × treatment condition interaction, p = .02). This effect was independent of antiretroviral (ARV) medication use. Additional analyses indicated that treatment adherence to the mindfulness meditation program, as measured by class attendance, mediated the effects of mindfulness meditation training on buffering CD4+ T lymphocyte declines. These findings provide an initial indication that mindfulness meditation training can buffer CD4+ T lymphocyte declines in HIV-1 infected adults.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ageing is characterized by a number of physical changes that contribute to a decline in the ability to perform daily tasks. Stretching has been proposed to reduce hip flexion contracture and increase hip and pelvis range of motion, thus improving gait performance. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a supervised stretching program designed to improve the range of motion of the lower limbs alters gait kinematics in older adults. METHODS: Twenty healthy older adult women (65.9 +/- 4.2 years old and BMI 24.9 +/- 3.5) were divided into 2 groups. The experimental group undertook 12 sessions of stretching exercises, whereas the control group did not engage in any physical activity. Gait performance was assessed at the beginning of the experiment and after the 4-week intervention period. RESULTS: Those in the experimental group showed increased step length, higher velocity and reduced double support time after training. In addition, participants involved in the stretching program showed greater anterior and lateral pelvis tilt and also greater rotation (p {$<$} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, we can suggest that a supervised stretching program is effective to alter a number of gait variables. Moreover, after the stretching protocol, aged participants displayed gait parameters which were similar to those reported in young healthy adults. Therefore, stretching can be used as an effective means to improve range of motion and reverse some age-related changes that influence gait performance.},

DESIGN National Institute of Mental Health Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program surveys conducted between 1980 and 1984. SETTING Community populations in New Haven, Conn; Baltimore, Md; St Louis, Mo; Durham, NC; and Los Angeles, Calif. PARTICIPANTS A total of 18,056 adult participants selected by probability sampling within census tracts and households. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Summary scores for the MMSE are given in the form of mean, median, and percentile distributions specific for age and educational level. RESULTS The MMSE scores were related to both age and educational level. There was an inverse relationship between MMSE scores and age, ranging from a median of 29 for those 18 to 24 years of age, to 25 for individuals 80 years of age and older. The median MMSE score was 29 for individuals with at least 9 years of schooling, 26 for those with 5 to 8 years of schooling, and 22 for those with 0 to 4 years of schooling. CONCLUSIONS Cognitive performance as measured by the MMSE varies within the population by age and education. The cause of this variation has yet to be determined. Mini-Mental State Examination scores should be used to identify current cognitive difficulties and not to make formal diagnoses. The results presented should prove to be useful to clinicians who wish to compare an individual patient's MMSE scores with a population reference group and to researchers making plans for new studies in which cognitive status is a variable of interest.},

First, in response to heightened concern that our published research literature is incomplete and untrustworthy, we need new requirements to ensure research integrity. These include prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of selection and other inappropriate data-analytic practices, complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a cumulative quantitative discipline.},

Because p values dominate statistical analysis in psychology, it is important to ask what p says about replication. The answer to this question is “Surprisingly little.” In one simulation of 25 repetitions of a typical experiment, p varied from {$<$}.001 to .76, thus illustrating that p is a very unreliable measure. This article shows that, if an initial experiment results in two-tailed p = .05, there is an 80\% chance the one-tailed p value from a replication will fall in the interval (.00008, .44), a 10\% chance that p {$<$}.00008, and fully a 10\% chance that p {$>$}.44. Remarkably, the interval—termed a p interval—is this wide however large the sample size. p is so unreliable and gives such dramatically vague information that it is a poor basis for inference. Confidence intervals, however, give much better information about replication. Researchers should minimize the role of p by using confidence intervals and model-fitting techniques and by adopting meta-analytic thinking.},

  abstract = {Over the last two decades, statistics educators have made important changes to introductory courses. Current guidelines emphasize developing statistical thinking in students and exposing them to the entire investigative process in the context of interesting research questions and real data. As a result, many concepts (confounding, multivariable models, study design, etc.) previously reserved only for higher-level courses now appear in introductory courses. Despite these changes, causality is rarely discussed in introductory courses, except for warning students “correlation does not imply causation” or covering the special case of randomized controlled experiments. In this paper, we argue causal inference concepts align well with statistics education guidelines for introductory courses by developing statistical and multivariable thinking, exposing students to many aspects of the investigative process, and fostering active learning. We discuss how to integrate causal inference concepts into introductory courses using causal diagrams and provide an illustrative example with youth smoking data. Through our website, we also provide a guided student activity and instructor resources.},

Methods Data from over 138 million county-level tweets were analyzed using predictive modeling, differential language analysis, and mediating language analysis. Results Twitter language data captures cross-sectional patterns of excessive alcohol consumption beyond that of sociodemographic factors (e.g. age, gender, race, income, education), and can be used to accurately predict rates of excessive alcohol consumption. Additionally, mediation analysis found that Twitter topics (e.g. ‘ready gettin leave’) can explain much of the variance associated between socioeconomics and excessive alcohol consumption. Conclusions Twitter data can be used to predict public health concerns such as excessive drinking. Using mediation analysis in conjunction with predictive modeling allows for a high portion of the variance associated with socioeconomic status to be explained.},

We compared the accuracies of RF and four other commonly used statistical classifiers using data on invasive plant species presence in Lava Beds National Monument, California, USA, rare lichen species presence in the Pacific Northwest, USA, and nest sites for cavity nesting birds in the Uinta Mountains, Utah, USA. We observed high classification accuracy in all applications as measured by cross-validation and, in the case of the lichen data, by independent test data, when comparing RF to other common classification methods. We also observed that the variables that RF identified as most important for classifying invasive plant species coincided with expectations based on the literature.},

  abstract = {Causal inference goes beyond prediction by modeling the outcome of interventions and formalizing counterfactual reasoning. Instead of restricting causal conclusions to experiments, causal inference explicates the conditions under which it is possible to draw causal conclusions even from observational data. In this paper, I provide a concise introduction to the graphical approach to causal inference, which uses Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to visualize, and Structural Causal Models (SCMs) to relate probabilistic and causal relationships. Successively, we climb what Judea Pearl calls the "causal hierarchy" --- moving from association to intervention to counterfactuals. I explain how DAGs can help us reason about associations between variables as well as interventions; how the do-calculus leads to a satisfactory definition of confounding, thereby clarifying, among other things, Simpson's paradox; and how SCMs enable us to reason about what could have been. Lastly, I discuss a number of challenges in applying causal inference in practice.}

In particular, little research in this field has examined the nature of mindfulness and whether it relates to task performance in organizational and occupational settings. Filling these gaps, the present article delineates mindfulness by (a) defining it as a state of consciousness in which attention is focused on present-moment phenomena occurring both externally and internally, (b) comparing it to a range of other attention-related concepts, and (c) developing theory concerning the factors that determine when mindfulness is beneficial versus costly from a task performance standpoint.},

In groups of size 3, males reported no faster than females, and females reported no slower when the 1 other bystander was a male rather than a female. In general, personality and background measures were not predictive of helping. Bystander inaction in real-life emergencies is often explained by "apathy," "alienation," and "anomie." This experiment suggests that the explanation may lie more in the bystander's response to other observers than in his indifference to the victim.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The underlying changes in biological processes that are associated with reported changes in mental and physical health in response to meditation have not been systematically explored. We performed a randomized, controlled study on the effects on brain and immune function of a well-known and widely used 8-week clinical training program in mindfulness meditation applied in a work environment with healthy employees. METHODS: We measured brain electrical activity before and immediately after, and then 4 months after an 8-week training program in mindfulness meditation. Twenty-five subjects were tested in the meditation group. A wait-list control group (N = 16) was tested at the same points in time as the meditators. At the end of the 8-week period, subjects in both groups were vaccinated with influenza vaccine. RESULTS: We report for the first time significant increases in left-sided anterior activation, a pattern previously associated with positive affect, in the meditators compared with the nonmeditators. We also found significant increases in antibody titers to influenza vaccine among subjects in the meditation compared with those in the wait-list control group. Finally, the magnitude of increase in left-sided activation predicted the magnitude of antibody titer rise to the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that a short program in mindfulness meditation produces demonstrable effects on brain and immune function. These findings suggest that meditation may change brain and immune function in positive ways and underscore the need for additional research.},

Collectively, these individual differences have been described as affective style. Recent research has begun to dissect the constituents of affective style. The search for these components is guided by the neural systems that instantiate emotion and emotion regulation. In this article, this body of research and theory is applied specifically to positive affect and well-being. The central substrates and peripheral biological correlates of well-being are described. A resilient affective style is associated with high levels of left prefrontal activation, effective modulation of activation in the amygdala and fast recovery in response to negative and stressful events. In peripheral biology, these central patterns are associated with lower levels of basal cortisol and with higher levels of antibody titres to influenza vaccine. The article concludes with a consideration of whether these patterns of central and peripheral biology can be modified by training and shifted toward a more salubrious direction.},

Associations between technology use and negative correlates (e.g., depression and anxiety) remain common. However, pre-registered studies have failed to replicate these findings. Regardless of direction, many designs rely on psychometric scales that claim to define and quantify a construct associated with technology engagement. These often suggest clinical manifestations present as disorders or addictions. Given their importance for research integrity, we consider what these scales might be measuring. Across three studies, we observe that many psychometric scales align with a single, identical construct despite claims they capture something unique. We conclude that many technology measures appear to measure a similar, poorly defined construct that sometimes overlaps with pre-existing measures of well-being. Social scientists should critically consider how they proceed methodologically and conceptually when developing psychometric scales in this domain to ensure research findings sit on solid foundations.},

  abstract = {The mass adoption of digital technologies continues to generate psychological debate on how they impact people and society. A considerable body work has observed associations between technology use and a variety of negative outcomes including depression, anxiety, sleep, and cognitive impairments. However, the debate is far from settled with large, pre-registered studies failing to replicate these controversial findings. Unifying much of this work is the reliance on subjective estimates or self-reported smartphone ‘usage’ scales. These have repeatedly failed to align with objective behavior. As with other areas of psychometric assessment, researchers may now ask themselves what are these scales are actually measuring? Across three studies, we first observe that the majority of highly cited scales have not been developed in line with best psychometric practice. Next, using a principal component analysis (PCA), we then demonstrate that many scales are likely to be measuring a single, identical construct. Finally, we demonstrate an overlap between these scales and mental health, using both latent relationship (EFA) and data reduction (PCA) perspectives. These findings help explain why negative associations will always appear between technology use and well-being when using these measures. Our results suggest that psychologists need to critically consider how they proceed both methodologically and conceptually when developing psychometric scales if research findings are to ever be drawn together into a coherent body of knowledge.}

  abstract = {Valid measurement scales for predicting user acceptance of computers are in short supply. Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of.98 for usefulness and.94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.}

Für eine angemessene Reaktion ist nicht nur ein erhebliches Sachwissen erforderlich, sondern auch die Fähigkeit, dies mit Blick auf die Erfordernisse einer nachhaltigen und gerechten Entwicklung in wirksames Handeln umzusetzen. Ohne eine weltweite Bildungsinitiative, so hatte es schon die UNCED-Konferenz in Rio de Janeiro 1992 in der Agenda 21 festgehalten, ist dies nicht zu gewährleisten. Auf der Grundlage klarer begrifflicher Unterscheidungen zwischen einem planungsrationalen Konzept der Nachhaltigkeit und einem an die moralphilosophische Tradition anschließenden Konzept der Gerechtigkeit markiert die Studie die Handlungserfordernisse und analysiert die Handlungshemmnisse, die es dabei zu überwinden gilt. Daraus werden systematisch die Kompetenzen abgeleitet, über die jeder Handelnde verfügen muss und um deren Vermittlung sich schulische Bildung verstärkt bemühen sollte, wenn eine nachhaltige und gerechte Entwicklung gelingen soll. Die durch eine interdisziplinär besetzte Forschergruppe erarbeitete Studie richtet sich an alle, die als Entscheidungsträger, als Teil der wissenschaftlich beratenden Infrastruktur oder als Praktiker vor Ort" für die Gestaltung und Umsetzung der Bildung für eine nachhaltige und gerechte Entwicklung Verantwortung tragen.},

  abstract = {Summary. This paper puts forward an overall view of statistics. It is argued that statistics is the study of uncertainty. The many demonstrations that uncertainties can only combine according to the rules of the probability calculus are summarized. The conclusion is that statistical inference is firmly based on probability alone. Progress is therefore dependent on the construction of a probability model; methods for doing this are considered. It is argued that the probabilities are personal. The roles of likelihood and exchangeability are explained. Inference is only of value if it can be used, so the extension to decision analysis, incorporating utility, is related to risk and to the use of statistics in science and law. The paper has been written in the hope that it will be intelligible to all who are interested in statistics},

  abstract = {Extraversion has two central characteristics: (1) interpersonal engagement, which consists of affiliation (enjoying and valuing close interpersonal bonds, being warm and affectionate) and agency (being socially dominant, enjoying leadership roles, being assertive, being exhibitionistic, and having a sense of potency in accomplishing goals) and (2) impulsivity, which emerges from the interaction of extraversion and a second, independent trait (constraint). Agency is a more general motivational disposition that includes dominance, ambition, mastery, efficacy, and achievement. Positive affect (a combination of positive feelings and motivation) is closely associated with extraversion. Extraversion is accordingly based on positive incentive motivation. Parallels between extraversion (particularly its agency component) and a mammalian behavioral approach system based on positive incentive motivation implicate a neuroanatomical network and modulatory neurotransmitters in the processing of incentive motivation. A corticolimbic-striatal-thalamic network (1) integrates the salient incentive context in the medial orbital cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus; (2) encodes the intensity of incentive stimuli in a motive circuit composed of the nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, and ventral tegmental area dopamine projection system; and (3) creates an incentive motivational state that can be transmitted to the motor system. Individual differences in the functioning of this network arise from functional variation in the ventral tegmental area dopamine projections, which are directly involved in coding the intensity of incentive motivation. The animal evidence suggests that there are three neurodevelopmental sources of individual differences in dopamine: genetic, "experience-expectant," and "experience-dependent." Individual differences in dopamine promote variation in the heterosynaptic plasticity that enhances the connection between incentive context and incentive motivation and behavior. Our psychobiological threshold model explains the effects of individual differences in dopamine transmission on behavior, and their relation to personality traits is discussed.},

The need to discriminate human writing from AI is now both critical and urgent. Addressing this need, we report a method for discriminating text generated by ChatGPT from (human) academic scientists, relying on prevalent and accessible supervised classification methods. The approach uses new features for discriminating (these) humans from AI; as examples, scientists write long paragraphs and have a penchant for equivocal language, frequently using words like “but,” “however,” and “although.” With a set of 20 features, we built a model that assigns the author, as human or AI, at over 99\% accuracy. This strategy could be further adapted and developed by others with basic skills in supervised classification, enabling access to many highly accurate and targeted models for detecting AI usage in academic writing and beyond.},

  abstract = {Although the methodological literature is replete with advice regarding the development and validation of multi-item scales based on reflective measures, the issue of index construction using formative measures has received little attention. The authors seek to address this gap by (1) examining the nature of formative indicators, (2) discussing ways in which the quality of formative measures can be assessed, and (3) illustrating the proposed procedures with empirical data. The aim is to enhance researchers' understanding of formative measures and assist them in their index construction efforts.}

  abstract = {W. Wilson's (1967) review of the area of subjective well-being (SWB) advanced several conclusions regarding those who report high levels of "happiness." A number of his conclusions have been overturned: youth and modest aspirations no longer are seen as prerequisites of SWB. E. Diener's (1984) review placed greater emphasis on theories that stressed psychological factors. In the current article, the authors review current evidence for Wilson's conclusions and discuss modern theories of SWB that stress dispositional influences, adaptation, goals, and coping strategies. The next steps in the evolution of the field are to comprehend the interaction of psychological factors with life circumstances in producing SWB, to understand the causal pathways leading to happiness, understand the processes underlying adaptation to events, and develop theories that explain why certain variables differentially influence the different components of SWB (life satisfaction, pleasant affect, and unpleasant affect).

  abstract = {Honey bees provide a model system to elucidate the relationship between sociality and complex behaviors within the same species, as females (workers) are highly social and males (drones) are more solitary. We report on aversive learning studies in drone and worker honey bees (Apis mellifera anatolica) in escape, punishment and discriminative punishment situations. In all three experiments, a newly developed electric shock avoidance assay was used. The comparisons of expected and observed responses were performed with conventional statistical methods and a systematic randomization modeling approach called object oriented modeling. The escape experiment consisted of two measurements recorded in a master--yoked paradigm: frequency of response and latency to respond following administration of shock. Master individuals could terminate an unavoidable shock triggered by a decrementing 30 s timer by crossing the shuttlebox centerline following shock activation. Across all groups, there was large individual response variation. When assessing group response frequency and latency, master subjects performed better than yoked subjects for both workers and drones. In the punishment experiment, individuals were shocked upon entering the shock portion of a bilaterally wired shuttlebox. The shock portion was spatially static and unsignalled. Only workers effectively avoided the shock. The discriminative punishment experiment repeated the punishment experiment but included a counterbalanced blue and yellow background signal and the side of shock was manipulated. Drones correctly responded less than workers when shock was paired with blue. However, when shock was paired with yellow there was no observable difference between drones and workers.}

  abstract = {Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a program that has been shown to be beneficial for clinical and non-clinical populations. While much attention has been paid to participants' outcomes, little work has been published concerning processes underlying improvements. Herein, women who had finished medical treatment for breast cancer completed questionnaires pre- and post-MBSR and were interviewed using focus group methodology such that quantitative and qualitative data were combined to explore potential mechanisms underlying changes. It was found that the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale was a useful process measure to assess changes in mindfulness and that the Coping with Health Injuries and Problems questionnaire was useful in documenting changes in palliative (self-care) coping over the course of the 8 week program. Moreover, the Sense of Coherence questionnaire suggested that the women viewed life as more meaningful and manageable following MSBR. Our findings fit with Shapiro et al.'s theory that, over time, participants in an MBSR program "reperceive" what they encounter in their daily experiences.},

  abstract = {Polysomnography is used increasingly to investigate patients with possible sleep apnoea/ hypopnoea syndrome (SAHS), but it has not been assessed critically. We thus examined prospectively the value of electrophysiological and respiratory monitoring in 200 consecutive adults (163 men, 37 women; mean [SD] age 50 [13] years) having polysomnography. At polysomnography, 91 patients had SAHS ({$>$}15 apnoeas+hypopnoeas [A+H] per h asleep) and 11 had periodic limb-movement disorder. Recording sleep electrophysiologically was of no diagnostic value and SAHS could be as accurately defined by A + H per time in bed as by A + H per time asleep. 66\% of patients with SAHS could bediagnosed with oximetryalone, but many of the undiagnosed patients had moderately severe SAHS and benefited from treatment. Neurophysiological sleep recording is unnecessary and oximetry alone is of limited value in the overnight investigation of patients suspected of having SAHS.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility of creating a valid and reliable checklist with the following features: appropriate for assessing both randomised and non-randomised studies; provision of both an overall score for study quality and a profile of scores not only for the quality of reporting, internal validity (bias and confounding) and power, but also for external validity. DESIGN: A pilot version was first developed, based on epidemiological principles, reviews, and existing checklists for randomised studies. Face and content validity were assessed by three experienced reviewers and reliability was determined using two raters assessing 10 randomised and 10 non-randomised studies. Using different raters, the checklist was revised and tested for internal consistency (Kuder-Richardson 20), test-retest and inter-rater reliability (Spearman correlation coefficient and sign rank test; kappa statistics), criterion validity, and respondent burden. MAIN RESULTS: The performance of the checklist improved considerably after revision of a pilot version. The Quality Index had high internal consistency (KR-20: 0.89) as did the subscales apart from external validity (KR-20: 0.54). Test-retest (r 0.88) and inter-rater (r 0.75) reliability of the Quality Index were good. Reliability of the subscales varied from good (bias) to poor (external validity). The Quality Index correlated highly with an existing, established instrument for assessing randomised studies (r 0.90). There was little difference between its performance with non-randomised and with randomised studies. Raters took about 20 minutes to assess each paper (range 10 to 45 minutes). CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that it is feasible to develop a checklist that can be used to assess the methodological quality not only of randomised controlled trials but also non-randomised studies. It has also shown that it is possible to produce a checklist that provides a profile of the paper, alerting reviewers to its particular methodological strengths and weaknesses. Further work is required to improve the checklist and the training of raters in the assessment of external validity.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Many changes have been initiated in the Dutch hospital sector to optimize health-care delivery: national agenda-setting, increased competition and transparency, a new system of hospital reimbursement based on diagnosis-treatment combinations, intensified monitoring of quality and a multi-layered organizational development programme based on quality improvement collaboratives. The objective is to answer the question as to whether these changes were accompanied by a further development of hospital quality management systems and to what extent did the development within the multi-layered programme hospitals differ from that in other hospitals. DESIGN: Longitudinal data were collected in 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2007 using a validated questionnaire. Descriptive analyses and multi-level modelling were applied to test whether: (1) quality management system development stages in hospitals differ over time, (2) development stages and trends differ between hospitals participating or not participating in the multi-layered programme and (3) hospital size has an effect on development stage. SETTING: Dutch hospital sector between 1995 and 2007. PARTICIPANTS: Hospital organizations. INTERVENTION: Changes through time. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Quality management system development stage. RESULTS: Since 1995, hospital quality management systems have reached higher development levels. Programme participants have developed their quality management system more rapidly than have non-participants. However, this effect is confounded by hospital size. CONCLUSIONS: Study results suggest that the combination of policy measures at macro level was accompanied by an increase in hospital size and the further development of quality management systems. Hospitals are entering the stage of systematic quality improvement.},

The ability to successfully distinguish between tumor classes (already known or yet to be discovered) using gene expression data is an important aspect of this novel approach to cancer classification.

This meta-ignorance (or ignorance of ignorance) arises because lack of expertise and knowledge often hides in the realm of the “unknown unknowns” or is disguised by erroneous beliefs and background knowledge that only appear to be sufficient to conclude a right answer. As empirical evidence of meta-ignorance, I describe the Dunning–Kruger effect, in which poor performers in many social and intellectual domains seem largely unaware of just how deficient their expertise is. Their deficits leave them with a double burden—not only does their incomplete and misguided knowledge lead them to make mistakes but those exact same deficits also prevent them from recognizing when they are making mistakes and other people choosing more wisely. I discuss theoretical controversies over the interpretation of this effect and describe how the self-evaluation errors of poor and top performers differ. I also address a vexing question: If self-perceptions of competence so often vary from the truth, what cues are people using to determine whether their conclusions are sound or faulty?},

RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: P-values in scientific studies are used to determine whether a null hypothesis formulated before the performance of the study is to be accepted or rejected. In exploratory studies, p-values enable the recognition of any statistically noteworthy findings. Confidence intervals provide information about a range in which the true value lies with a certain degree of probability, as well as about the direction and strength of the demonstrated effect. This enables conclusions to be drawn about the statistical plausibility and clinical relevance of the study findings. It is often useful for both statistical measures to be reported in scientific articles, because they provide complementary types of information.},

This is necessary to keep medical knowledge up to date and to ensure optimal patient care. The aim of this paper is to present an accessible introduction into critical appraisal of scientific articles. METHODS: Using a selection of international literature, the reader is introduced to the principles of critical reading of scientific articles in medicine. For the sake of conciseness, detailed description of statistical methods is omitted. RESULTS: Widely accepted principles for critically appraising scientific articles are outlined. Basic knowledge of study design, structuring of an article, the role of different sections, of statistical presentations as well as sources of error and limitation are presented. The reader does not require extensive methodological knowledge. As far as necessary for critical appraisal of scientific articles, differences in research areas like epidemiology, clinical, and basic research are outlined. Further useful references are presented. CONCLUSION: Basic methodological knowledge is required to select and interpret scientific articles correctly.},

  abstract = {Describes how motivational processes influence a child's acquisition, transfer, and use of knowledge and skills. Recent research within the social-cognitive framework illustrates adaptive and maladaptive motivational patterns, and a research-based model of motivational processes is presented that shows how the particular performance or learning goals children pursue on cognitive tasks shape their reactions to success and failure and influence the quality of their cognitive performance. Implications for practice and the design of interventions to change maladaptive motivational processes are outlined. It is suggested that motivational patterns may contribute to gender differences in mathematics achievement and that empirically based interventions may prevent current achievement discrepancies and provide a basis for more effective socialization.

  abstract = {People generally prefer their initials to the other letters of the alphabet, a phenomenon known as the name-letter effect. This effect, researchers have argued, makes people move to certain cities, buy particular brands of consumer products, and choose particular professions (e.g., Angela moves to Los Angeles, Phil buys a Philips TV, and Dennis becomes a dentist). In order to establish such associations between people's initials and their behavior, researchers typically carry out statistical analyses of large databases. Current methods of analysis ignore the hierarchical structure of the data, do not naturally handle order-restrictions, and are fundamentally incapable of confirming the null hypothesis. Here we outline a Bayesian hierarchical analysis that avoids these limitations and allows coherent inference both on the level of the individual and on the level of the group. To illustrate our method, we re-analyze two data sets that address the question of whether people are disproportionately likely to live in cities that resemble their name.},

DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS To identify representational requirements of nursing assessments, the authors mapped key concepts and semantic relations extracted from standardized and local nursing admission assessment documentation forms/templates and inpatient admission assessment records to the ICNP. Next, they expanded the list of ICNP semantic relations with those obtained from the admission assessment forms/templates. The expanded ICNP semantic relations were then validated against the semantic relations identified from an additional set of admission assessment records and a set of 300 randomly selected North American Nursing Diagnosis Association defining characteristic phrases. The concept coverage of the ICNP was evaluated by mapping the concepts extracted from these sources to the ICNP concepts. The UMLS Methathesaurus was then used to map concepts without exact matches to other American Nursing Association (ANA) recognized terminologies. RESULTS The authors found that along with the 30 existing ICNP semantic relations, an additional 17 are required for the ICNP to function as a representational model for nursing assessment documentation. Eight hundred and five unique assessment concepts were extracted from all sources. Forty-three percent of these unique assessment concepts had exact matches in the ICNP. An additional 20\% had matches in the ICNP classified as narrower, broader, or "other." Of the concepts without exact matches in the ICNP, 81\% had exact matches found in other ANA recognized terminologies. CONCLUSIONS The broad concept coverage and the logic-based structure of the ICNP make it a flexible and robust standard. The ICNP provides a framework from which to capture and reuse atomic level data to facilitate evidence-based practice.},

The lecture was brilliant, bold and controversial. It generated much discussion and some criticism, but it did stimulate the audience, which included the reviewer. The historical account of the breakdown in communications between mathematicians and physicists and of the lack of interest in Maxwell's equations constitutes an indictment of the mathematical community. The discovery of the invariance of Maxwell's equations under the Lorentz group had to wait for Minkowski, and some of its simple consequences for Cartan, Weyl and Einstein. Grassmann's "Ausdehnungslehre'', Hamilton's quaternions, and Feynman sums constitute some of the remaining examples of opportunities which the mathematicians have missed, or are perhaps still missing. The lecture closed with an appropriate reference to Hadamard.}

In general, these findings are consistent with a social-role theory of sex differences, which emphasizes the causal impact of gender roles-that is, of people's beliefs about the behavior that is appropriate for each sex. To move beyond the demonstration of consistency between role expectations and social behavior, meta-analyses have examined the moderators and mediators specified by this theoretical model The outcomes of these moderator and mediator analyses are illustrated from several meta-analyses of gender and social behavior. These meta-analyses thus show that quantitative reviewing is not limited to the mere summarizing of research findings; the technique also allows reviewers to examine the plausibility of theories that are relevant to these findings.}

  abstract = {Previous meta-analyses on the effects of mindfulness meditation were predominantly concerned with clinical research. In contrast, the present study aims at giving a comprehensive overview of the effects of mindfulness meditation on various psychological variables, for meditators in nonclinical settings. Included are 39 studies that fulfilled our six selection criteria: (1) a mindfulness meditation treatment, (2) the existence of an inactive control group, (3) a population of nonclinical adults, (4) the investigation of psychological measures that were (5) assessed at temporal distance from a meditation session, and (6) the availability of sufficient data to calculate effect sizes. The dependent variables examined included, among others, attention, intelligence, self-attributed mindfulness, positive and negative emotions, emotion regulation, personality traits, self-concept, self-realization, stress, and well-being. We found an effect size of \$\$ \textbackslash overline r = 0.27 \$\$ averaged across all studies and dependent variables. The effects differed widely across dependent variables. Moreover, we found large differences between the effect sizes reported for complete Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programs vs. “pure” meditation. MBSR seems to have its most powerful effect on attaining higher psychological well-being, whereas pure mindfulness meditation studies reported the largest effects on variables associated with the concept of mindfulness. This raises the question if some effect sizes found for MBSR might be partly inflated by effects that are not attributable to its mindfulness meditation component. Future theorizing should address meditation-specific concepts more extensively to account for the changes in healthy practitioners.},

During the time that an incentive is behaviorally salient, an organism is especially responsive to incentive-related cues. This sustained sensitivity requires postulating a continuing state (denoted by a construct, current concern) with a definite onset (commitment) and offset (consummation or disengagement). Disengagement follows frustration, accompanies the behavioral process of extinction, and involves an incentive-disengagement cycle of invigoration, aggression, depression, and recovery. Depression is thus a normal part of disengagement that may be either adaptive or maladaptive for the individual but is probably adaptive for the species. The theory offers implications for motivation; etiology, symptomatology, and treatment of depression; drug use; and other social problem areas.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE To evaluate completeness, granularity, multiple axial content, and clinical utility of the beta version of the ICNP in the context of standardized nursing care planning in a clinical setting. METHODS An 35-bed acute care ward for infectious diseases at a Swedish university hospital was selected for clinical testing. A convenience sample of 56 patient records with data on nutrition and skin care was analyzed and mapped to the ICNP. FINDINGS Using the ICNP terminology, 59\%-62\% of the record content describing nursing phenomena and 30\%-44\% of the nursing interventions in the areas of nutrition and skin care could be expressed satisfactorily. For about a quarter of the content describing nursing phenomena and interventions, no corresponding ICNP term was found. CONCLUSIONS The ICNP needs to be further developed to allow representation of the entire range of nursing care. Terms need to be developed to express patient participation and preferences, normal conditions, qualitative dimensions and characteristics, nonhuman focus, and duration. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS The practical usefulness of the ICNP needs further testing before conclusions about its clinical benefits can be determined.},

  abstract = {Background: Repetitive loading to the hip joint in athletes has been reported as a factor in the development of degenerative joint disease and intra-articular injury. Little information is available on the bilateral symmetry of hip rotational measures in unilaterally dominant upper extremity athletes.Hypothesis: Side-to-side differences in hip joint range of motion may be present because of asymmetrical loading in the lower extremities of elite tennis players and professional baseball pitchers.Study Design: Cohort (cross-sectional) study (prevalence); Level of evidence, 1.Methods: Descriptive measures of hip internal and external rotation active range of motion were taken in the prone position of 64 male and 83 female elite tennis players and 101 male professional baseball pitchers using digital photos and computerized angle calculation software. Bilateral differences in active range of motion between the dominant and nondominant hip were compared using paired t tests and Bonferroni correction for hip internal, external, and total rotation range of motion. A Pearson correlation test was used to test the relationship between years of competition and hip rotation active range of motion.Results: No significant bilateral difference (P {$>$} .005) was measured for mean hip internal or external rotation for the elite tennis players or the professional baseball pitchers. An analysis of the number of subjects in each group with a bilateral difference in hip rotation greater than 10\,° identified 17\% of the professional baseball pitchers with internal rotation differences and 42\% with external rotation differences. Differences in the elite male tennis players occurred in only 15\% of the players for internal rotation and 9\% in external rotation. Female subjects had differences in 8\% and 12\% of the players for internal and external rotation, respectively. Statistical differences were found between the mean total arc of hip range of internal and external rotation in the elite tennis players with the dominant side being greater by a clinically insignificant mean value of 2.5\,°. Significantly less (P {$<$} .005) dominant hip internal rotation and less dominant and nondominant hip total rotation range of motion were found in the professional baseball pitchers compared with the elite male tennis players.Conclusion: This study established typical range of motion patterns and identified bilaterally symmetric hip active range of motion rotation values in elite tennis players and professional baseball pitchers. Asymmetric hip joint rotational active range of motion encountered during clinical examination and screening may indicate abnormalities and would indicate the application of flexibility training, rehabilitation, and further evaluation.}

Using a sample of 188 young adults who forecasted their emotions for the weeks following the 2008 Presidential election, we tested our prediction that facets of mindfulness would decrease the impact bias, a well-known error in affective forecasting. Mindfulness was measured with the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (Baer, Smith, Hopkins, Krietemeyer, \& Toney, 2006). One facet of mindfulness, observing one's internal state, was associated with more moderate affective forecasts as well as a decreased susceptibility to the impact bias. Findings highlight sources of individual differences in susceptibility to the impact bias and shed light on how to improve people's ability to forecast for emotional experiences.},

The present research however demonstrates that the sentencing decisions of experienced legal professionals are influenced by irrelevant sentencing demands even if they are blatantly determined at random. Participating legal experts anchored their sentencing decisions on a given sentencing demand and assimilated toward it even if this demand came from an irrelevant source (Study 1), they were informed that this demand was randomly determined (Study 2), or they randomly determined this demand themselves by throwing dice (Study 3). Expertise and experience did not reduce this effect. This sentencing bias appears to be produced by a selective increase in the accessibility of arguments that are consistent with the random sentencing demand: The accessibility of incriminating arguments was higher if participants were confronted with a high rather than a low anchor (Study 4). Practical and theoretical implications of this research are discussed.},

One mechanism through which mindfulness may reduce psychological symptoms and promote functioning is enhancing emotional responding and regulation. In this study, we used multimodal assessment to examine the effects of a brief mindfulness intervention in a laboratory setting on emotional experiences and regulation in response to distressing, positive, and affectively mixed film clips. Although there were no condition (mindfulness vs. control) effects on reports of emotional response or difficulties in regulation after the distressing film clip, participants in the mindfulness condition reported significantly greater positive affect in response to the positive film. Additionally, participants in the mindfulness condition reported more adaptive regulation (approaching significance, medium to large effect size) in response to the affectively mixed clip and significantly less negative affect immediately after this clip, although not after a recovery period. No significant differences emerged between conditions on physiological measures (skin conductance and heart rate) throughout the study.},

  abstract = {This study examines the effects of puberty and sex on the intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of brain networks, with a focus on the default-mode network (DMN). Consistently implicated in depressive disorders, the DMN's function may interact with puberty and sex in the development of these disorders, whose onsets peak in adolescence, and which show strong sex disproportionality (females\,\,males). The main question concerns how the DMN evolves with puberty as a function of sex. These effects are expected to involve within- and between-network iFC, particularly, the salience and the central-executive networks, consistent with the Triple-Network Model. Resting-state scans of an adolescent community sample (n\,=\,304, male/female: 157/147; mean/std age: 14.6/0.41 years), from the IMAGEN database, were analyzed using the AFNI software suite and a data reduction strategy for the effects of puberty and sex. Three midline regions (medial prefrontal, pregenual anterior cingulate, and posterior cingulate), within the DMN and consistently implicated in mood disorders, were selected as seeds. Within- and between-network clusters of the DMN iFC changed with pubertal maturation differently in boys and girls (puberty-X-sex). Specifically, pubertal maturation predicted weaker iFC in girls and stronger iFC in boys. Finally, iFC was stronger in boys than girls independently of puberty. Brain-behavior associations indicated that lower connectivity of the anterior cingulate seed predicted higher internalizing symptoms at 2-year follow-up. In conclusion, weaker iFC of the anterior DMN may signal disconnections among circuits supporting mood regulation, conferring risk for internalizing disorders.}

The introduction is geared toward reviewers, editors, and interested researchers who are new to Bayesian statistics. We provide commentary for eight recommended sources, which together cover the theoretical and practical cornerstones of Bayesian statistics in psychology and related sciences. The resources are presented in an incremental order, starting with theoretical foundations and moving on to applied issues. In addition, we outline an additional 32 articles and books that can be consulted to gain background knowledge about various theoretical specifics and Bayesian approaches to frequently used models. Our goal is to offer researchers a starting point for understanding the core tenets of Bayesian analysis, while requiring a low level of time commitment. After consulting our guide, the reader should understand how and why Bayesian methods work, and feel able to evaluate their use in the behavioral and social sciences.},

  abstract = {In recent years, three attentional networks have been defined in anatomical and functional terms. These functions involve alerting, orienting, and executive attention. Reaction time measures can be used to quantify the processing efficiency within each of these three networks. The Attention Network Test (ANT) is designed to evaluate alerting, orienting, and executive attention within a single 30-min testing session that can be easily performed by children, patients, and monkeys. A study with 40 normal adult subjects indicates that the ANT produces reliable single subject estimates of alerting, orienting, and executive function, and further suggests that the efficiencies of these three networks are uncorrelated. There are, however, some interactions in which alerting and orienting can modulate the degree of interference from flankers. This procedure may prove to be convenient and useful in evaluating attentional abnormalities associated with cases of brain injury, stroke, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit disorder. The ANT may also serve as an activation task for neuroimaging studies and as a phenotype for the study of the influence of genes on attentional networks.},

  abstract = {The hypothesis of a Hierarchy of the Sciences with physical sciences at the top, social sciences at the bottom, and biological sciences in-between is nearly 200 years old. This order is intuitive and reflected in many features of academic life, but whether it reflects the "hardness" of scientific research--i.e., the extent to which research questions and results are determined by data and theories as opposed to non-cognitive factors--is controversial. This study analysed 2434 papers published in all disciplines and that declared to have tested a hypothesis. It was determined how many papers reported a "positive" (full or partial) or "negative" support for the tested hypothesis. If the hierarchy hypothesis is correct, then researchers in "softer" sciences should have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases, and therefore report more positive outcomes. Results confirmed the predictions at all levels considered: discipline, domain and methodology broadly defined. Controlling for observed differences between pure and applied disciplines, and between papers testing one or several hypotheses, the odds of reporting a positive result were around 5 times higher among papers in the disciplines of Psychology and Psychiatry and Economics and Business compared to Space Science, 2.3 times higher in the domain of social sciences compared to the physical sciences, and 3.4 times higher in studies applying behavioural and social methodologies on people compared to physical and chemical studies on non-biological material. In all comparisons, biological studies had intermediate values. These results suggest that the nature of hypotheses tested and the logical and methodological rigour employed to test them vary systematically across disciplines and fields, depending on the complexity of the subject matter and possibly other factors (e.g., a field's level of historical and/or intellectual development). On the other hand, these results support the scientific status of the social sciences against claims that they are completely subjective, by showing that, when they adopt a scientific approach to discovery, they differ from the natural sciences only by a matter of degree.},

  abstract = {Concerns that the growing competition for funding and citations might distort science are frequently discussed, but have not been verified directly. Of the hypothesized problems, perhaps the most worrying is a worsening of positive-outcome bias. A system that disfavours negative results not only distorts the scientific literature directly, but might also discourage high-risk projects and pressure scientists to fabricate and falsify their data. This study analysed over 4,600 papers published in all disciplines between 1990 and 2007, measuring the frequency of papers that, having declared to have “tested” a hypothesis, reported a positive support for it. The overall frequency of positive supports has grown by over 22\% between 1990 and 2007, with significant differences between disciplines and countries. The increase was stronger in the social and some biomedical disciplines. The United States had published, over the years, significantly fewer positive results than Asian countries (and particularly Japan) but more than European countries (and in particular the United Kingdom). Methodological artefacts cannot explain away these patterns, which support the hypotheses that research is becoming less pioneering and/or that the objectivity with which results are produced and published is decreasing.},

  abstract = {Mindfulness involves nonjudgmental attention to present-moment experience. In its therapeutic forms, mindfulness interventions promote increased tolerance of negative affect and improved well-being. However, the neural mechanisms underlying mindful mood regulation are poorly understood. Mindfulness training appears to enhance focused attention, supported by the anterior cingulate cortex and the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). In emotion regulation, these PFC changes promote the stable recruitment of a nonconceptual sensory pathway, an alternative to conventional attempts to cognitively reappraise negative emotion. In neural terms, the transition to nonconceptual awareness involves reducing evaluative processing, supported by midline structures of the PFC. Instead, attentional resources are directed toward a limbic pathway for present-moment sensory awareness, involving the thalamus, insula, and primary sensory regions. In patients with affective disorders, mindfulness training provides an alternative to cognitive efforts to control negative emotion, instead directing attention toward the transitory nature of momentary experience. Limiting cognitive elaboration in favour of momentary awareness appears to reduce automatic negative self-evaluation, increase tolerance for negative affect and pain, and help to engender self-compassion and empathy in people with chronic dysphoria.},

METHODS Using item reconstruction rules, items were developed for the ICF chapters "mobility", "self-care" and "domestic life". The resulting instrument, together with other instruments (SF-36, Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment Questionnaire (SMFA), MacNew, Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Barthel) was presented to 549 patients with musculoskeletal disease, 212 patients with cardiac disease and 258 neurological rehabilitation patients in rehabilitation clinics in Germany. RESULTS The MOSES questionnaire includes 58 items on 12 scales and fulfills the requirements of the 1-parameter item response theory model (Rasch model). The results indicate good reliability and high construct validity and sensitivity to change of the instrument. In the construction and selection of items, ICF contents that include complex processes of evaluation, and which presuppose skills that are not acquired prior to the individual learning process, were omitted due to a lack of unidimensionality. CONCLUSION The successful implementation of the concept of applying rules to ICF categories in formulating the items of a patient questionnaire showed that the goal of a theory-driven measurement of activities using the ICF is feasible. The results of the project also raise questions as to the homogeneity of the contents of some ICF categories.},

Flexibility can be achieved by a variety of stretching techniques, yet little research has been performed on the most effective method. The 2 basic types include active stretching, in which range of motion is increased through voluntary contraction, and passive stretching, in which range of motion is increased through external assistance. The 2 types of active stretching include neuromobilization and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF). Our study aims to determine which type of stretching technique is most effective in improving hamstring length. One hundred subjects between the ages of 21 and 57 were enrolled in the study. Intrarater reliability of hamstring length measurement was performed using 10 subjects. All 100 subjects were included in a randomized controlled trial of 5 different groups comparing different hamstring-stretching techniques. Outcome measures, including hamstring length and perceived level of hamstring tightness, were recorded on all subjects initially, at 4 weeks, and at 8 weeks. After 4 weeks of stretching, there was a statistically significant improvement in hamstring length (p {$<$} 0.05) using active stretches as compared with passive stretches. From weeks 4 through 8, hamstring length for the active stretching groups decreased. After 8 weeks of stretching, the straight leg raise (SLR) passive stretch group had the greatest improvement in hamstring length. There was no correlation between hamstring flexibility and age, initial tightness, or frequency of exercise per week. Improvement in hamstring flexibility was greatest for the SLR passive stretch. Also, using PNF in the 90/90 active stretch provided better knee range-of-motion improvements than the 90/90 passive methods did.},

  abstract = {In light of the upcoming eleventh edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), the question arises as to the most appropriate classification of 'Pathological Gambling' ('PG'). Some academic opinion favors leaving PG in the 'Impulse Control Disorder' ('ICD') category, as in ICD-10, whereas others argue that new data especially from the neurobiological area favor allocating it to the category of 'Substance-related and Addictive Disorders' ('SADs'), following the decision in the fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The current review examines important findings in relation to PG, with the aim of enabling a well-informed decision to be made with respect to the classification of PG as a SAD or ICD in ICD-11. Particular attention is given to cognitive deficits and underlying neurobiological mechanisms that play a role in SADs and ICDs. These processes are impulsivity, compulsivity, reward/punishment processing and decision-making. In summary, the strongest arguments for subsuming PG under a larger SAD category relate to the existence of similar diagnostic characteristics; the high co-morbidity rates between the disorders; their common core features including reward-related aspects (positive reinforcement: behaviors are pleasurable at the beginning which is not the case for ICDs); the findings that the same brain structures are involved in PG and SADs, including the ventral striatum. Research on compulsivity suggests a relationship with PG and SAD, particularly in later stages of the disorders. Although research is limited for ICDs, current data do not support continuing to classify PG as an ICD.},

  abstract = {The number of massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) is on the rise worldwide along with the fascination that they inspire. Problems occur when the use of MMOs becomes excessive at the expense of other life domains. Although not yet formally included as disorder in common diagnostic systems, internet gaming disorder (IGD) is considered a "condition for further study" in section III of the DSM-5. The current review aims to provide an overview of cognitive and neurobiological data currently available on IGD, with a particular focus on impulsivity, compulsivity, and sensitivity to reward and punishment. Additionally, we also compare these findings on IGD with data from studies on pathological gambling (PG)-so far the only condition officially classified as a behavioral addiction in the DSM-5. Multiple similarities have been observed in the neurobiology of IGD and PG, as measured by alterations in brain function and behavior. Both patients with IGD and those with PG exhibited decreased loss sensitivity; enhanced reactivity to gaming and gambling cues, respectively; enhanced impulsive choice behavior; aberrant reward-based learning; and no changes in cognitive flexibility. In conclusion, the evidence base on the neurobiology of gaming and gambling disorders is beginning to illuminate the similarities between the two. However, as only a few studies have addressed the neurobiological basis of IGD, and some of these studies suffer from significant limitations, more research is required before IGD's inclusion as a second behavioral addiction in the next versions of the ICD and DSM can be justified.},

Our systematic search in PubMed yielded a total of 70 fMRI studies out of which 57 were finally considered. We have summarized the study results based on their main research focus as follows: studies on neural correlates of reward processing (alcohol cues (N\,=\,17), non-drug cues (N\,=\,3)), decision making (N\,=\,2), attention (N\,=\,5), impulsivity and cognitive control (N\,=\,1), pharmacological effects/treatment responses (N\,=\,13) and relapse prediction (N\,=\,6). Neuroimaging genetics studies have mainly considered the impact of various functional polymorphisms on alcohol cue processing (N\,=\,10). These results indicate that recent research on AUDs has concentrated on reward processing (mainly alcohol cue reactivity). Possible directions for future research are discussed.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stretching protocols for elderly people ({$>$} or = 65 years of age) have not been studied to determine the effectiveness of increasing range of motion (ROM). The purpose of this study was to determine which of 3 durations of stretches would produce and maintain the greatest gains in knee extension ROM with the femur held at 90 degrees of hip flexion in a group of elderly individuals. SUBJECTS: Sixty-two subjects (mean age = 84.7 years, SD = 5.6, range = 65-97) with tight hamstring muscles (defined as the inability to extend the knee to less than 20 degrees of knee flexion) participated. Subjects were recruited from a retirement housing complex and were independent in activities of daily living. METHODS: Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups and completed a physical activity questionnaire. The subjects in group 1 (n = 13, mean age = 85.1 years, SD = 6.4, range = 70-97), a control group, performed no stretching. The randomly selected right or left limb of subjects in group 2 (n = 17, mean age = 85.5 years, SD = 4.5, range = 80-93), group 3 (n = 15, mean age = 85.2 years, SD = 6.5, range = 65-92), and group 4 (n = 17, mean age = 83.2 years, SD = 4.6, range = 68-90) was stretched 5 times per week for 6 weeks for 15, 30, and 60 seconds, respectively. Range of motion was measured once a week for 10 weeks to determine the treatment and residual effects. Data were analyzed using a growth curve model. RESULTS: A 60-second stretch produced a greater rate of gains in ROM (60-second stretch = 2.4 degrees per week, 30-second stretch = 1.3 degrees per week, 15-second stretch = 0.6 degrees per week), which persisted longer than the gains in any other group (group 4 still had 5.4 degrees more ROM 4 weeks after treatment than at pretest as compared with 0.7 degrees and 0.8 degrees for groups 2 and 3, respectively). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Longer hold times during stretching of the hamstring muscles resulted in a greater rate of gains in ROM and a more sustained increase in ROM in elderly subjects. These results may differ from those of studies performed with younger populations because of age-related physiologic changes.},

This makes a suitable categorization for scientific use almost impossible. However, empirical data suggest that different forms of meditation show similar steps of development in terms of their neurophysiological correlates. Some electrophysiological alterations can be observed on the beginner/student level, which are closely related to non-meditative processes. Others seem to correspond to an advanced/expert level, and seem to be unique for meditation-related states of consciousness. Meditation is one possibility to specialize brain/mind functions using the brain's immanent neural plasticity. This plasticity is probably recruited by certain EEG patterns observed during or as a result of meditation, for instance, synchronized gamma oscillations. While meditation formerly has been understood to comprise mainly passive relaxation states, recent EEG findings suggest that meditation is associated with active states which involve cognitive restructuring and learning.},

We used Medline to identify all epidemiologic studies of major joint contractures published from 1966 to March 2005. There was a high prevalence of major joint contractures. Most studies focused on one joint rather than including all relevant major contractures. However, most studies did provide a definition of a contracture or the measures used to assess contractures. Immobility is a highly prevalent disability in at-risk populations, and constitutes a tremendous burden to patients in nursing homes, hospitals, and the outpatient community. The lack of epidemiologic data is a major impediment to providing appropriate treatment. Level of Evidence: Level III, systematic review.

  abstract = {Mindfulness has been proposed as a useful adjunct to alcohol abuse treatment. However, very little research has examined the basic relationship between alcohol use and mindfulness. Inconsistency in definition and measurement of mindfulness across studies makes such research difficult to interpret and conduct. Therefore, the current research sought to validate an emerging mindfulness measure, the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and examine its relationship with alcohol use and alcohol-related negative consequences among a sample of 316 college-aged adults. The purported factor structure of the FFMQ was examined using confirmatory factor analysis. Structural equation modeling was used to examine relations among mindfulness, alcohol use, and alcohol-related negative consequences. Consistent with past research, results supported the five-factor structure of the FFMQ. Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that two awareness-based factors of mindfulness were negatively related to alcohol use. After controlling for alcohol use, one acceptance-based factor (nonjudging of thoughts and feelings) was negatively related to alcohol-related consequences, and one awareness-based factor was positively related to consequences (all ps {$<$} .05). Effect sizes were small-medium. The results reported here inform the burgeoning development of mindfulness-based addiction treatment and provide additional psychometric validation of the FFMQ.},

  abstract = {Published January 2006, 223 pages. SUMMARY: Dashboards have become popular in recent years as uniquely powerful tools for communicating important information at a glance. Although dashboards are potentially powerful, this potential is rarely realized. The greatest display technology in the world won't solve this if you fail to use effective visual design. And if a dashboard fails to tell you precisely what you need to know in an instant, you'll never use it, even if it's filled with cute gauges, meters, and traffic lights. Don't let your investment in dashboard technology go to waste. This book will teach you the visual design skills you need to create dashboards that communicate clearly, rapidly, and compellingly. "Information Dashboard Design" will explain how to: Avoid the thirteen mistakes common to dashboard design Provide viewers with the information they need quickly and clearly Apply what we now know about visual perception to the visual presentation of information Minimize distractions, cliches, and unnecessary embellishments that create confusion Organize business information to support meaning and usability Create an aesthetically pleasing viewing experience Maintain consistency of design to provide accurate interpretation Optimize the power of dashboard technology by pairing it with visual effectiveness Stephen Few has over 20 years of experience as an IT innovator, consultant, and educator. As Principal of the consultancy Perceptual Edge, Stephen focuses on data visualization for analyzing and communicating quantitative business information. He provides consulting and training services, speaks frequently at conferences, and teaches in the MBA program at the University of California in Berkeley.

Its linear and no-frills design provides a rich display of data in a small space, which is essential on a dashboard. Like most meters and gauges, bullet graphs feature a single quantitative measure (for example, year-to-date revenue) along with complementary measures to enrich the meaning of the featured measure. Specifically, bullet graphs support the comparison of the featured measure to one or more related measures (for example, a target or the same measure at some point in the past, such as a year ago) and relate the featured measure to defined quantitative ranges that declare its qualitative state (for example, good, satisfactory, and poor). Its linear design not only gives it a small footprint, but also supports more efficient reading than radial meters.},

Have these calls for change had an impact on the statistical reporting practices in conservation biology? In 2000 and 2001, 92\% of sampled articles in Conservation Biology and Biological Conservation reported results of null-hypothesis tests. In 2005 this figure dropped to 78\%. There were corresponding increases in the use of confidence intervals, information theoretic, and Bayesian techniques. Of those articles reporting null-hypothesis testing--which still easily constitute the majority--very few report statistical power (8\%) and many misinterpret statistical nonsignificance as evidence for no effect (63\%). Overall, results of our survey show some improvements in statistical practice, but further efforts are clearly required to move the discipline toward improved practices.},

This book is the best blend that I know of a textbook in statistics and a manual on SPSS. It is a balanced composite of both topics, using SPSS to illustrate important statistical material and, through graphics, to make visible important approaches to data analysis. There are many places in the book where I had to laugh, and that's saying a lot for a book on statistics. His excellent style engages the reader and makes reading about statistics fun' - David C Howell, Professor Emeritus, University of Vermont USA This award-winning text, now fully updated with SPSS Statistics, is the only book on statistics that you will need! Fully revised and restructured, this new edition is even more accessible as it now takes students through from introductory to advanced level concepts, all the while grounding knowledge through the use of SPSS Statistics. Andy Field's humorous and self-deprecating style and the book's host of characters make the journey entertaining as well as educational. While still providing a very comprehensive collection of statistical methods, tests and procedures, and packed with examples and self-assessment tests to reinforce knowledge, the new edition now also offers: - a more gentle introduction to basic-level concepts and methods for beginners - new textbook features to make the book more user-friendly for those learning about more advanced concepts, encouraging 'critical thinking' - a brand new, full-colour design, making it easy for students to navigate between topics, and to understand how to use the latest version of SPSS Statistics - both 'real world' (the bizarre and the wonderful) and invented examples illustrate the concepts and make the techniques come alive for students - an additional chapter on multilevel modelling for advanced-level students - reinforced binding to make the book easier to handle at a computer workstation. The book also includes access to a brand new and improved companion Website, bursting with features including: - animated 'SPSS walk-through' videos clearly demonstrating how to use the latest SPSS Statistics modules - self-marking multiple choice questions - data sets for psychology, business and management and health sciences - a flash-card glossary for testing knowledge of key concepts - access to support material from SAGE study skills books. Statistics lecturers are also provided with a whole range of resources and teaching aids, including: - the test bank - over 300 multiple-choice questions ready to upload to WebCT, Blackboard or other virtual learning environments - charts and diagrams in electronic format for inclusion in lecture slides - PowerPoint slides written by the author to accompany chapters of the text.},

Questionnaires were completed by 428 respondents, comprising a sample accessed via the Internet (n = 319) and a sample who completed a paper and pencil version of the measures (n = 109). Using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) the two-factor structure of the CPAQ in the Internet sample was supported, though a good model fit was only achieved following the removal of one item. The resultant 19 item CPAQ demonstrated good reliability and evidence of validity was obtained for this sample. Data from the Internet sample were used to derive an eight-item short form. The two four-item factors (activity engagement [AE] and pain willingness [PW]) were confirmed using CFA and found to be invariant across both samples with good scale reliability. Higher CPAQ-8 and subscale scores were correlated with less depression and anxiety, pain severity and pain interference, and fewer medical visits for pain. Using structural equation modelling both subscales were found to partially mediate the impact of pain severity on pain interference and emotional distress. In this model AE had stronger associations with outcomes while PW accounted for a small portion of the variance in pain interference and anxiety, but not depression. This study confirmed the two-factor structure of the CPAQ in a mixed chronic pain Internet sample and provides preliminary evidence for the psychometric soundness of the CPAQ-8.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim was to translate, revise, and standardize the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) by Levenstein et al. (1993) in German. The instrument assesses subjectively experienced stress independent of a specific and objective occasion. METHODS: Exploratory factor analyses and a revision of the scale content were carried out on a sample of 650 subjects (Psychosomatic Medicine patients, women after delivery, women after miscarriage, and students). Confirmatory analyses and examination of structural stability across subgroups were carried out on a second sample of 1,808 subjects (psychosomatic, tinnitus, inflammatory bowel disease patients, pregnant women, healthy adults) using linear structural equation modeling and multisample analyses. External validation included immunological measures in women who had suffered a miscarriage. RESULTS: Four factors (worries, tension, joy, demands) emerged, with 5 items each, as compared with the 30 items of the original PSQ. The factor structure was confirmed on the second sample. Multisample analyses yielded a fair structural stability across groups. Reliability values were satisfactory. Findings suggest that three scales represent internal stress reactions, whereas the scale "demands" relates to perceived external stressors. Significant and meaningful differences between groups indicate differential validity. A higher degree of certain immunological imbalances after miscarriage (presumably linked to pregnancy loss) was found in those women who had a higher stress score. Sensitivity to change was demonstrated in two different treatment samples. CONCLUSION: We propose the revised PSQ as a valid and economic tool for stress research. The overall score permits comparison with results from earlier studies using the original instrument.},

  abstract = {Mindfulness and acceptance have been associated with the so-called third-wave behavior therapies within clinical psychology. They came from a range of philosophical origins, including problems with mechanistic approaches that focused on eliminating problematic thoughts and feelings. This concern led to a philosophical shift in cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) associated with a pragmatic analysis of treatment with a emphasis on understanding behaviors as acts in context. Theories associated with this new perspective include acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT; an adaptation of mindfulness-based stress reduction, or MBSR), and functional analytic psychotherapy. In this chapter, we examine the historical evolution, research evidence, treatment processes, and future directions of mindfulness and acceptance. Although these concepts have most recently been associated with the third-wave therapies, their origins are indeed quite old, with roots in ancient Eastern philosophical and spiritual traditions. A number of theories, such as those from existential–humanistic approaches, have focused on being present and acceptance of one’s current condition. We provide historical and conceptual issues that are shared in the two traditions. We then focus on specifics of some of the dominant therapies that use mindfulness and acceptance in treatment. In concluding, we describe how the integration of mindfulness and acceptance has led to a different approach to modern psychotherapy and offer future directions for the field.

  abstract = {Mindfulness-based interventions are efficacious in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms, but mechanisms underlying these benefits have not been fully elucidated. Based on cognitive theories of depression and anxiety, a reduction in negatively biased cognition may be one mechanism. We reviewed the empirical literature on mindfulness and negatively biased cognition. Thirty-seven studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria. The evidence generally indicated that mindfulness was inversely associated with negatively biased cognition, across various measures (i.e., self-reported negatively biased cognitive styles and cognitive responses to tasks involving valenced stimuli), study designs (i.e., correlational, quasi-experimental, and experimental), and samples (i.e., unselected and clinical). However, the relation was mixed for cognitive reactivity to negative emotions in recurrent depression and null for indices of quick behavioral control. Correlational evidence in unselected samples also supported an indirect relation between mindfulness and fewer depression and anxiety symptoms through less negatively biased cognition. Mindfulness may be useful for addressing this intended mechanism of traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy. Future research should more directly test the role of negatively biased cognition in protective and therapeutic effects of mindfulness.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: High prevalence of depression has been reported in otorhinolaryngologic patients (ORL). However, studies using a semi-structured interview to determine the prevalence of depression in ORL are lacking. Therefore the present study sought to determine the depression prevalence in ORL applying a semi-structured diagnostic interview and to further characterize the pathopsychological and demographic characteristics of depression in these patients. METHODS: One-hundred inpatients of the otorhinolaryngologic department of a German university hospital participated voluntarily (age M = 38.8 years, SD = 13.9; 38.0\% female). Depression was assessed using a clinical interview in which the International Diagnostic Checklist for depression (IDCL) was applied. Patients completed the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) which constitutes three composite scores and nine symptom scales and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Multivariate analyses of variance, correlations and effect sizes were conducted. RESULTS: A prevalence of depression of 21.0\% was determined, 38.0\% of the depressed patients were female. Depressed patients showed higher scores on the BSI-scales "interpersonal sensitivity", "depression", "anxiety", "phobic anxiety" and "psychoticism" with medium effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of depression was found which is in accordance with results of prior studies. Depressed patients showed higher psychological distress as compared to non-depressed patients. The results call for carrying on in engaging in depression research and routine depression screening in ORL.},

  abstract = {Innovative approaches are urgently needed to improve behavioral treatment for weight loss. The weight regain that is so common after treatment may be a result of an environment that makes it challenging to adhere, long-term, to a dietary and physical activity regimen. This study was designed to test, via a 12-week open trial, the preliminary feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, and possible mechanisms of action of a behavioral treatment that was modified to incorporate acceptance-based therapy components designed to (a) bolster participants' commitment to behavior change, (b) build distress-tolerance skills, and (c) promote mindful awareness of eating behaviors and goals. Participants (n = 29) were overweight or obese women. Among completers (n = 19; 34\% attrition), weight loss averaged 6.6\% of body weight at posttreatment and 9.6\% at 6-month follow-up (n = 14; 52\% attrition). Intention-to-treat weight losses were 4.5\% at posttreatment and 6.6\% at 6-month follow-up. Psychological variables targeted by the intervention (e.g., cognitive restraint, disinhibition, urge-related eating behavior, emotional eating, eating-related experiential acceptance, mindfulness and motivation) changed in the expected directions, and many of these changes were consistent with decreases in weight loss. Moreover, despite the limitations of the single-group design, this pilot study demonstrated the preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a novel, acceptance-based behavioral treatment for obesity. One potential implication is that behaviorally based weight loss interventions might be improved by overlaying an acceptance-based framework.}

  abstract = {Despite the long history of therapeutic experience with different types and amounts of passive joint motion, its effects and the principles of its use remain controversial. Through empiric success, a spectrum of passive motion has evolved for various clinical purposes, including joint diagnosis; correction of joint deformities; mobilization of stiff joints; stimulation of joint healing; neuromuscular re-education; and prevention of immobilization complications (e.g., contracture formation, connective tissue atrophy, relative healing inhibition, and associated stasis abnormalities). However, the potential abuses of passive motion (e.g., causing additional tissue trauma, mobilizing unprotected joints, and stretching the wrong joints or tissues) have created serious doubts as to the value of this therapy and raised important questions concerning the lack of proper definition (e.g., force, direction, speed, and duration) and the unknown margins of safety. Clinical and experimental evidence supports the probable effectiveness of passive joint motion on joint and tissue levels, but without a better quantitative understanding of the mechanisms of action, dose-responsiveness, specific tissue effects, and, most important, their controls. Thus, passive motion will continue to be used suboptimally with inconsistent results. When these clinical and research deficiencies are corrected, passive motion will attain its proper place as a powerful and reliable orthopedic tool.},

Vielmehr erfüllt der Homo Oe- conomicus als Erklärungskonzept aggregierten menschlichen Verhaltens eine methodologi- sche Funktion. Mit ihm sollen gesellschaftliche Makrophänomene, und nicht einzelnes indivi- duelles Verhalten, erklärt werden; er ist somit eine „heuristische Fiktion`` oder ein „Idealty- pus``.

The responses of N = 14,624 students who participated in the PISA assessments of the years 2000, 2003, and 2006 in Germany were used to simulate MAT with different restrictions (unrestricted, treatment of link items, treatment of open items, content balance, unitwise item selection, all restrictions). Compared with conventional testing based on the booklet design of PISA 2006, unrestricted MAT increases measurement efficiency by 74\% and reduces the average number of presented items from 55 to 26 without a loss in measurement precision. The incorporation of restrictions reduces the advantages of MAT. MAT is recommended for the assessment of newly introduced constructs but not for the assessment of the literacy domains in PISA.},

This idea, termed effect-ordered data displays, applies principally to the arrangement of unordered factors for quantitative data and frequency data, and to the arrangement of variables and observations in multivariate displays (star plots, parallel coordinate plots, and so forth).As examples of this principle, we present several techniques for ordering items, levels or variables "optimally", based on some desired criterion. All of these may be based on eigenvalue or singular-value decompositions.Along the way, we tell some stories about data display, illustrated by graphs--some surprisingly bad, and some surprisingly good--for showing patterns, trends, and anomalies in data. We hope to raise more questions than we can provide answers for.},

  abstract = {TextbfDie Macht der Hilfsverben Ja doch, die Welt ver ndern. Das wollte er und sch mte sich nicht daf r, vom Haben und vom Sein schrieb er und von der Chance, die es gebe, der Diktatur des Habens zu entfliehen, er schrieb es in einer Zeit, als das h ssliche Wort Gutmenschentum noch nicht erfunden war, das heute alles zu ersticken vermag, was nach utopischem Denken klingt. Es war 1976, als Haben oder Sein`` erschien, das Jahr der Dioxin-Katastrophe in Seveso, das Jahr der ersten gro en Brokdorf-Demonstration: Der Psychoanalytiker, Philosoph, Sozialforscher Erich Fromm, 1900 geboren, schrieb sein sp tes Werk hinein in eine Zeit, die sehr empf nglich daf r war. Jene Zeit, als auf B cherregalen die blauen Marx-Engels-B nde zur Seite ger ckt wurden, um Platz zu schaffen f r die Texte der Frauen-, der Schwulen-, der Alternativbewegung; als die Bibliografien geisteswissenschaftlicher Werke zwangsl ufig mit A wie Adorno begannen; Fromm stand nicht in jeder Literaturliste, doch im Gegensatz zu Adorno, seinem Mitstreiter und Rivalen aus dem legend ren Frankfurter Institut f r Sozialforschung, wurde er tats chlich gelesen. Gelesen und zitiert und zu Tode paraphrasiert, seine Kunst des Liebens`` vor allem, 1956 erschienen und millionenfach verkauft. Nicht klammern, loslassen, zu sich selber finden, jenes Siebziger-Jahre-Begleitgemurmel f r Beziehungsdiskussion und Gesellschaftsanalyse, h ufig fand es seine Quellen in den Schriften des Sozialwissenschaftlers Fromm, was ihm den Ruf des weichgesp lten Kuschelphilosophen verschaffte, den man schlie lich nicht mehr lesen mochte, sehr zu Unrecht, wie ein frischer Blick auf sein Werk erschlie t. Haben oder Sein - Die seelischen Grundlagen einer neuen Gesellschaft`` schrieb er im Tessin lebend, nach Europa zur ckgekehrt aus jahrzehntelangem Exil in Mexiko und den USA, den ersten Herzinfarkt hatte er hinter sich, es blieb sein letzter gro er Text. Haben und Sein - zwei substantivierte Verben, aus denen eine Weltsicht entsteht. Zwei Menschentypen, zwei Gesellschaftstypen besiedeln die Welt: Das Haben entspricht dem Geist einer nekrophilen Gesellschaft, die tote Dinge verehrt, w hrend die biophile Gesellschaft des Seins den Menschen als ihren Mittelpunkt begreift. Fromm schrieb das in eine Zeit hinein, die begann, ber die Grenzen des Wachstums`` zu diskutieren, der erste Bericht des Club of Rome war erschienen, das britische Atomkraftwerk Sellafield, war knapp an einer Katastrophe vorbeigeschrammt, er schrieb es in einer Welt des Habens, so befand er, die ihre Lebensgrundlagen vernichtet und sich nur ndern kann, wenn sich auch die Psyche des Menschen ndert, der in ihr lebt. Scharfsichtig und sehr aktuell seine Analyse des Marketing-Charakters`` des modernen Menschen, schon in den vierziger Jahren hat er sie entwickelt, nun f hrt er sie n her aus: Alles ist abgestellt auf vor bergehende Befriedigung, auf Verschlei . Der Konsument, jener ewige S ugling, der nach der Flasche schreit``, kennzeichnet diese Welt des Habens, kurzfristig nur identifiziert er sich mit modernen Gebrauchsgegenst nden, deren wesentliche Eigenschaft es ist, berholt und beseitigt zu werden. Alles ist austauschbar, Dinge, Meinungen, Einstellungen, Freunde, Liebespartner, und der Mensch selbst beginnt sein konstantes Selbst einzub en, wird zur Ware auf dem Pers nlichkeitsmarkt``, die sich vorteilhaft pr sentieren muss, die sich selbst verkauft: Ich bin, was ich habe, und was ich habe, hat mich. Als Vision setzt er dagegen eine Welt des Seins. Aus Marx und Buddha und Jesus und Freud speist sich diese Vision, dazu Spinoza und Meister Eckhart, er sagt: Es gibt Hoffnung, die Welt ist ver nderbar. Fromm ist der Erfinder der Analytischen Sozialphilosophie, er war von 1930 an Mitarbeiter in Max Horkheimers Institut f r Sozialforschung und bis zum Zerw rfnis im Exil in den sp ten drei iger Jahren eine der pr genden Pers nlichkeiten der Frankfurter Schule, und er hat eine andere Botschaft als die pessimistische seiner Kollegen. Sp ttisch zitiert wurde im Institut gern ein Spruch, der ihn seit seiner Jugend begleitete: Lieber Gott, mach mich wie Erich Fromm, dass ich in den Himmel komm.`` Was ungerecht ist, denn Fromm sagt nicht: Alles wird gut. Er sagt, dass die Chancen gering bleiben, da es zu den notwendigen menschlichen und gesellschaftlichen Ver nderungen kommt``. Aber er sagt auch, beides sei im Menschen angelegt, das Sein und das Haben, und stark beeinflusst werde er durch den Charakter der Gesellschaft, in der er lebt. Beides m sse ver ndert werden, der Mensch und die Gesellschaft, und bei beidem lohne der Versuch - was ermutigender klingt als die Botschaft Adornos, derzufolge es kein richtiges Leben im falschen geben kann. Konturen der k nftigen Gesellschaft hat Fromm entworfen, manches davon wirkt wie im 21. Jahrhundert verfasst, der Aufruf zum Verbraucherboykott als gesellschaftspolitischem Druckmittel beispielsweise, die Forderung nach einem garantierten j hrlichen Mindesteinkommen f r jeden B rger, das liest sich wie Beitr ge zu den aktuellen Debatten der Republik. Anderes erscheint merkw rdig heute, abwegiger, seine Idee beispielsweise, einen Kulturrat`` ins Leben zu rufen, ein Gremium aus Vertretern der geistigen und k nstlerischen Elite des Landes, aus M nnern und Frauen, deren Integrit t ber jeden Zweifel erhaben ist`` - w rde man sie finden? Oder die Idee, ein System zur Verbreitung von echten Fakten und alternativen Denkans tzen, von objektiven Informationen`` zu etablieren - gibt es die? Es ist mehr der Blick aufs Ganze, der bei Fromm fasziniert, sein Ansatz, nicht nur das Individuum, sondern die Gesellschaft mit dem Blick des Psychoanalytikers zu studieren, und einer der interessantesten Aspekte daran ist sein Umgang mit dem Begriff Religion``. Fromm, ein Kind aus j disch-orthodoxem Hause, der sich, als er die Psychoanalyse entdeckt hat, entfernt von der Orthodoxie - er ist der Meinung, dass jede Gesellschaft eine Grundkonstante hat, ohne die sie nicht funktioniert: Sie muss das allen Menschen eigene religi se Bed rfnis erf llen``. Er meint nicht ein Glaubenssystem, das notwendigerweise mit einem Gottesbegriff operiert. Er meint jedes System des Denkens und Handelns, das dem Einzelnen einen Rahmen der Orientierung und ein Objekt der Hingabe bietet``. Hingabe an B ume, an Idole aus Gold, einen unsichtbaren Gott. An eine Nation, an eine Klasse, eine Partei, an eine ungefesselte Marktwirtschaft, an Geld oder Erfolg, all das ist f r ihn Religion, er fragt nicht Religion oder nicht Religion``, er fragt welche Religion``, und ob sie einen zerst rerischen Charakter f r die menschliche Gesellschaft hat. Er stellt die Ketzerfrage, ob die westliche Gesellschaft wirklich so christlich ist, wie sie sich d nkt - ihn erinnert die Verkl rung des Wettstreits, des Siegenm ssens in der Marktwirtschaft nicht an die Botschaft Jesu, unser Vorbild, sagt er, ist immer noch der heidnische Held``. Seine eigene Religion, die des radikalen Humanismus``, mag manchem gestrig erscheinen. Sie ist es nicht. Nachwort von Barbara Supp zu emphHaben oder Sein. SPIEGEL-Edition Band 28},

  abstract = {Mindfulness is conceived as a state in which the individual pays full attention to everything that is happening around him or her. The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) is the most popular instrument for assessing mindfulness. Studies on its structure have shown some conflicting results. This study aims to offer new evidence on the dimensionality and reliability of the MAAS, handling both SEM and IRT procedures, in palliative professionals. The sample was composed of 385 professionals from a national online survey. First, two Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFAs) were specified, estimated, and tested, with one- and two-factor structures, respectively. Second, the Graded Response Model (GRM) was used and accuracy of the MAAS using information functions was estimated. Results showed appropriate fit for the two CFA models. As the correlation between the two factors in the two-factor model was extremely high and the original authors posited a one-factor solution, this structure was retained for parsimony. The GRM also supported this structure, but found that the scale offered more information on professionals with lower levels of mindfulness, pointing at items 1, 2, 6, and 15 as the less discriminative, in line with the CFA lower factor loadings for these very same items.

Methods               An online survey in five language versions (German, English, French, Spanish, Italian) collected data from January to March 2020. A total of 92 questionnaire items on a visual analogue scale were submitted to exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis.                                         Results               Out of 3627 submitted responses, 1403 were usable. Participants had a median age of 52 years (range: 17–88) and were evenly split between men and women (48.5\% vs 50.0\%). The majority of meditators practiced regularly (77.3\%), were free of diagnosed mental disorders (92.4\%) and did not regularly use any psychoactive substances (84.0\%). Vipassana (43.9\%) followed by Zen (34.9\%) were the most frequently practiced meditation techniques. German (63.4\%) and English (31.4\%) were by far the most frequent questionnaire languages. A solution with 12 factors explaining 44\% of the total variance was deemed optimal under joint conceptual and statistical considerations. The factors were named “Time, Effort and Desire,” “Peace, Bliss and Silence,” “Self-Knowledge, Autonomous Cognizance and Insight,” “Wakeful Presence,” “Pure Awareness in Dream and Sleep,” “Luminosity,” “Thoughts and Feelings,” “Emptiness and Non-egoic Self-awareness,” “Sensory Perception in Body and Space,” “Touching World and Self,” “Mental Agency,” and “Witness Consciousness.” This factor structure fit the data moderately well.                                         Conclusions                                We have previously posited a                 phenomenological prototype                 for the experience of “pure awareness” as it occurs in the context of meditation practice. Here we offer a tentative 12-factor model to describe its phenomenal character in a fine-grained way. The current findings are in line with an earlier study extracting semantic constraints for a working definition of minimal phenomenal experience.},

  abstract = {Empathy plays a fundamental role in building relationships. To foster close relationships and lasting engagements between humans and robots, empathy models can provide direct clues into how it can be done. In this study, we focus on capturing in a quantitative way indicators of early empathy realization between a human and a robot using a process that encompasses affective attachment, trust, expectations and reflecting on the other’s perspective within a set of collaborative strategies. We hypothesize that an active collaboration strategy is conducive to a more meaningful and purposeful engagement of realizing empathy between a human and a robot compared to a passive one. With a deliberate design, the interaction with the robot was presented as a maze game where a human and a robot must collaborate in order to reach the goal using two strategies: one maintaining control individually taking turns (passive strategy) and the other one where both must agree on their next move based on reflection and argumentation. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the pilot study confirmed that a general sense of closeness with the robot was perceived when applying the active strategy. Regarding the specific indicators of empathy realization: (1) affective attachment, affective emulation was equally present throughout the experiment in both conditions, and thus, no conclusion could be reached; (2) trust, quantitative analysis partially supported the hypothesis that an active collaborative strategy will promote teamwork attitudes, where the human is open to the robot’s suggestions and to act as a teammate; and (3) regulating expectation, quantitative analysis confirmed that a collaborative strategy promoted a discovery process that regulates the subject’s expectation toward the robot. Overall, we can conclude that an active collaborative strategy impacts favorably the process of realizing empathy compared to a passive one. The results are compelling to move the design of this experiment forward into more comprehensive studies, ultimately leading to a path where we can clearly study engagements that reduce abandonment and disillusionment with the process of realizing empathy as the core design for active collaborative strategies.},

  abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to assess whether seventh-grade students use of information and communication technology (ICT) was related to performance on working memory tasks. In addition, the study tested whether the relationship between ICT use and performance on working memory tasks interacted with seventh-grade students' socioeconomic level and gender. 275 students recruited from 30 Chilean schools were grouped according to their self-reported use of PC, the Internet, Chat and Video games. To assess students' working memory performance, they were tested with a digit span test and a visuo-spatial measure. Only one of our two dependent variables reflected a relationship between specific profiles of ICT use and working memory. Higher scores on the digits span test were related to those user profiles combining PC use and video game play, that is, those identified as Full users and as PC and Console Gamers. We did not find an interaction effect of gender and ICT use or an interaction effect of socioeconomic level and ICT use. There are three possible explanations for these results: first, a proclivity of students with higher working memory capacity to engage in technology use; second, an impact on working memory of potential differences in multitasking; and, third, an impact on working memory of video game play. However, these results must be interpreted cautiously since scores on the GEFT, our visuo-spatial working memory measure, were not related to any profile of technology use. As serious educational games become more regularly used at school, previous differences in video game experience become growingly important. Future research must study whether the intended benefits of serious educational games are being mediated by individual differences in previous exposure to video games and other information and computer technologies, with independence of the directionality of the relationship between video game play and working memory. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {With a rapidly aging society it becomes increasingly important to counter normal age-related decline in cognitive functioning. Growing evidence suggests that cognitive training programs may have the potential to counteract this decline. On the basis of a growing body of research that shows that meditation has positive effects on cognition in younger and middle-aged adults, meditation may be able to offset normal age-related cognitive decline or even enhance cognitive function in older adults. In this paper, we review studies investigating the effects of meditation on age-related cognitive decline. We searched the Web of Science (1900 to present), PsycINFO (1597 to present), MEDLINE (1950 to present), and CABI (1910 to present) to identify original studies investigating the effects of meditation on cognition and cognitive decline in the context of aging. Twelve studies were included in the review, six of which were randomized controlled trials. Studies involved a wide variety of meditation techniques and reported preliminary positive effects on attention, memory, executive function, processing speed, and general cognition. However, most studies had a high risk of bias and small sample sizes. Reported dropout rates were low and compliance rates high. We conclude that meditation interventions for older adults are feasible, and preliminary evidence suggests that meditation can offset age-related cognitive decline.},

Next, key findings are discussed and used to advance propositions that relate psychological type to diverse topics such as risk tolerance, problem solving, information systems design, conflict management and leadership.

Some have suggested that this “OA Advantage” may not be causal but just a self-selection bias, because authors preferentially make higher-quality articles OA. To test this we compared self-selective self-archiving with mandatory self-archiving for a sample of 27,197 articles published 2002--2006 in 1,984 journals. Methdology/Principal Findings The OA Advantage proved just as high for both. Logistic regression analysis showed that the advantage is independent of other correlates of citations (article age; journal impact factor; number of co-authors, references or pages; field; article type; or country) and highest for the most highly cited articles. The OA Advantage is real, independent and causal, but skewed. Its size is indeed correlated with quality, just as citations themselves are (the top 20\% of articles receive about 80\% of all citations). Conclusions/Significance The OA advantage is greater for the more citable articles, not because of a quality bias from authors self-selecting what to make OA, but because of a quality advantage, from users self-selecting what to use and cite, freed by OA from the constraints of selective accessibility to subscribers only. It is hoped that these findings will help motivate the adoption of OA self-archiving mandates by universities, research institutions and research funders.}

  abstract = {Contemporary scholarship on mindfulness casts it as a form of purely nonevaluative engagement with experience. Yet, traditionally mindfulness was not intended to operate in a vacuum of dispassionate observation, but was seen as facilitative of eudaimonic mental states. In spite of this historical context, modern psychological research has neglected to ask the question of how the practice of mindfulness affects downstream emotion regulatory processes to impact the sense of meaning in life. To fill this lacuna, here we describe the mindfulness-to-meaning theory, from which we derive a novel process model of mindful positive emotion regulation informed by affective science, in which mindfulness is proposed to introduce flexibility in the generation of cognitive appraisals by enhancing interoceptive attention, thereby expanding the scope of cognition to facilitate reappraisal of adversity and savoring of positive experience. This process is proposed to culminate in a deepened capacity for meaning-making and greater engagement with life.},

This allows for the measurement of the similarity between dictionaries and spans of text ranging from complete documents to individual words. We show how DDR enables dictionary authors to place greater emphasis on construct validity without sacrificing linguistic coverage. We further demonstrate the benefits of DDR on two real-world tasks and finally conduct an extensive study of the interaction between dictionary size and task performance. These studies allow us to examine how DDR and word count methods complement one another as tools for applying concept dictionaries and where each is best applied. Finally, we provide references to tools and resources to make this method both available and accessible to a broad psychological audience.},

  abstract = {Can negative first names cause interpersonal neglect? Study 1 (N = 968) compared extremely negatively named online-daters with extremely positively named online-daters. Study 2 (N = 4,070) compared less extreme groups---namely, online-daters with somewhat unattractive versus somewhat attractive first names. Study 3 (N = 6,775) compared online-daters with currently popular versus currently less popular first names, while controlling for name-popularity at birth. Across all studies, negatively named individuals were more neglected by other online-daters, as indicated by fewer first visits to their dating profiles. This form of neglect arguably mirrors a name-based life history of neglect, discrimination, prejudice, or even ostracism. Supporting this argument, neglect mediated the relation between negative names and lower self-esteem, more frequent smoking, and less education. These results are consistent with the name-based interpersonal neglect hypothesis: Negative names evoke negative interpersonal reactions, which in turn influence people's life outcomes for the worse.}

The objective of this study was to validate this ICF Core Set from the perspective of physicians. METHODS Physicians experienced in rheumatoid arthritis treatment were asked about the problems they commonly treat in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in a 3-round survey using the Delphi technique. Responses were linked to the ICF. RESULTS Seventy-nine physicians in 41 countries named 512 patients' problems. Two hundred and 27 ICF categories were linked to these answers. Twenty-six ICF categories were not represented in the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for rheumatoid arthritis and 19 aspects were not covered by the ICF. CONCLUSION The content validity of 3 ICF components was well supported. However, several body functions were identified that are not covered and need to be investigated further.},

It is about using regression to solve real problems of comparison, estimation, prediction, and causal inference. Unlike other books, it focuses on practical issues such as sample size and missing data and a wide range of goals and techniques. It jumps right in to methods and computer code you can use immediately. Real examples, real stories from the authors' experience demonstrate what regression can do and its limitations, with practical advice for understanding assumptions and implementing methods for experiments and observational studies. They make a smooth transition to logistic regression and GLM. The emphasis is on computation in R and Stan rather than derivations, with code available online. Graphics and presentation aid understanding of the models and model fitting},

However, power analysis is flawed in that a narrow emphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study design. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can often be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of their own studies, we recommend design calculations in which (a) the probability of an estimate being in the wrong direction (Type S [sign] error) and (b) the factor by which the magnitude of an effect might be overestimated (Type M [magnitude] error or exaggeration ratio) are estimated. We illustrate with examples from recent published research and discuss the largest challenge in a design calculation: coming up with reasonable estimates of plausible effect sizes based on external information.},

More specifically, it is proposed that emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage moods and emotions in the self and others, contributes to effective leadership in organizations. Four major aspects of emotional intelligence, the appraisal and expression of emotion, the use of emotion to enhance cognitive processes and decision making, knowledge about emotions, and management of emotions, are described. Then, I propose how emotional intelligence contributes to effective leadership by focusing on five essential elements of leader effectiveness: development of collective goals and objectives; instilling in others an appreciation of the importance of work activities; generating and maintaining enthusiasm, confidence, optimism, cooperation, and trust; encouraging flexibility in decision making and change; and establishing and maintaining a meaningful identity for an organization.}

  abstract = {In the last few years, there has been a trend in the social and economic sciences to pay closer attention to individual preferences and values in establishing the microanalytical foundations for a theory of human action. Following a series of socio-psychological expansions of the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) survey in recent years, the questionnaire was rounded out further in the year 2005 to include personality indicators. This recent addition was based on the “Big Five” approach, a psychological concept used to describe and study personality. Fundamental to this approach is the assumption that personality differences between indi- viduals, which are manifested in different ways of behaving and experiencing the world, can be traced back to five basic personality traits: Neuroticism (N), Extraversion (E), Openness to experience (O), Agreeableness (A) and Conscientiousness (C). A pretest was conducted in 2004 on a number of different short item scales to test the Big Five approach, with the goal of developing a useful and widely applicable short item scale (BFI-S) for the 2005 SOEP survey. The short inventory of questions developed in the present study, BFI-S, contains 15 items and can be completed within two minutes. The items in the individual scales display strong inter- nal coherence, and was conceptualized based on the five-factor structure of the Big Five. Additionally, BFI-S is also able to replicate the results of the 25-item BFI to a large extent. The reliability test that was conducted also produced a satisfactory overall result, and showed strong empirical indications for the validity of the personality concept of the Big Five em- ployed in BFI-S.},

Qualitative content analysis of statements about PF was conducted using inductive coding. Results.{$\quad$}The searches yielded 353 citations, 79 papers were eligible for analyses. Five hundred thirty-eight statements about PF were extracted, condensed and coded. Beside conceptual statements, 238 examples of potential PF as well as five attempts at classifying PF were found in the literature. PF were considered in relation to clinical service provision, assessment and intervention, in research and social security contexts. PF were seen to be related to various aspects of health, functioning, disability and the environment. Conclusions.{$\quad$}The analysis of the literature shows that PF is seen as relevant to the application of the ICF in various settings. The review revealed a need for standardisation of PF. The literature points to the potential of PF in enhancing the understanding of functioning, disability and health, in facilitating interventions and services for people with disabilities, and strengthening the perspective of individuals in the ICF.}

  abstract = {In recent years there has been notable interest in additive models of sensory integration. Binaural additivity has emerged as a main hypothesis in the loudness-scaling literature and has recently been asserted by authors using an axiomatic approach to psychophysics. Restrictions of the range of stimuli used in the majority of former experiments, and inherent weaknesses of the axiomatic study by Levelt, Riemersma, and Bunt (1972) are discussed as providing reasons for the present investigation. A limited binaural additivity (LBA) model is proposed that assumes contralateral binaural inhibition for interaural intensity differences that exceed a critical level. Experimental data are reported for 12 subjects in a loudness-matching task designed to test the axioms of cancellation and of commutativity, both necessary to the existence of strict binaural additivity. In a 2 X 2 design, frequencies of 200 Hz and 2 kHz were used, and mean intensity levels were 20 dB apart. Additivity was found violated in 33 out of 48 possible tests. The LBA model is shown to predict the systematic nonadditivity in the loudness judgments and to conform to results from other studies.},

Healthy adults performed a temporal bisection task in which they had to categorize the presentation duration of pictures (neutral, liked, and disliked foods) as more similar to a short (400 ms) or to a long (1,600 ms) standard duration. The data revealed that the presentation duration of food pictures was underestimated compared with the presentation duration of the neutral picture, and that this underestimation was more marked for the disliked than for the liked food pictures. These results are consistent with the idea that this time underestimation arises from an attentional-bias mechanism. The food pictures, and particularly those depicting disliked food items, distracted attention away from the processing of time.},

  abstract = {In this research we investigated the role of mindfulness-based attention in mitigating possible negative consequences of experiencing depressive affect. A sample of 278 undergraduate college students completed self-report measures of depressive affect, negative cognitions, and mindfulness-based attention. As expected, depressive affect was positively related to negative cognitions, mindfulness-based attention was inversely related to negative cognitions, and the strength of the relationship between depressed affect and negative cognitions was significantly moderated by mindfulness-based attention. More specifically, a simple slope analysis revealed that individuals low in mindfulness-based attention evidenced a statistically significant relationship between depressive affect and negative cognitions, whereas individuals who are high in mindfulness-based attention did not. These findings support the extant literature suggesting that the general tendency to be mindful may be a protective factor against the development of psychopathology and enhance mental health.

  abstract = {In a world where encounters with dishonesty are frequent, it is important to know if exposure to other people's unethical behavior can increase or decrease an individual's dishonesty. In Experiment 1, our confederate cheated ostentatiously by finishing a task impossibly quickly and leaving the room with the maximum reward. In line with social-norms theory, participants' level of unethical behavior increased when the confederate was an in-group member, but decreased when the confederate was an out-group member. In Experiment 2, our confederate instead asked a question about cheating, which merely strengthened the saliency of this possibility. This manipulation decreased the level of unethical behavior among the other group members. These results suggest that individuals' unethicality does not depend on the simple calculations of cost-benefit analysis, but rather depends on the social norms implied by the dishonesty of others and also on the saliency of dishonesty.},

The authors highlight the opportunities afforded by this publicly reported data on hospital inpatients' experiences and perceptions of care. These data, reported on www.hospitalcompare.hhs. gov, facilitate the national comparison of patients' perspectives of hospital care and can be used alone or in conjunction with other clinical and outcome measures.

METHODS In a three-round electronic mail survey using the Delphi technique, occupational therapists experienced in stroke treatment were asked about patients'problems, patients' resources, and aspects of environment they take care of. Two health professionals linked responses to the ICF. FINDINGS Sixty-nine occupational therapists in 21 countries named 1,747 concepts that occupational therapists treat in patients with stroke. These concepts were linked to 347 different ICF categories. Twenty-three concepts were linked to the ICF component Personal Factors. CONCLUSION The content validity of the "ICF Core Set for stroke" was largely supported by occupational therapists.},

  abstract = {Rectangles haveing different ratios between the lengths of their sides were presented in three different ranges: with the golden section either (a) the next to most elongated rectangle, (b) the middle rectangle, or (c) the next to shortest rectangle. Each of 90 subjects had to pick the rectangles they liked best from all three ranges. This basic procedure was run under three different conditions: (a) subjects did not know the stimuli before, (b) subjects knew them from a foregoing psychophysical experiment, (c) the same, with reinforcing the golden section. The rectangles at both extremes of each range were chosen first most often under the first two conditions, whereas the golden section was chosen most often under the last condition. The conclusion is that preference for the golden section is an artifact of the stimulus range and of the demand characteristics of the experimental procedure rather than of any intrinsic aesthetic quality.},

Sixteen patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while encoding self-referential, valence, and orthographic features of social trait adjectives. Post- MBSR, 14 patients completed neuroimaging. Compared to baseline, MBSR completers showed (a) increased self-esteem and decreased anxiety, (b) increased positive and decreased negative self-endorsement, (c) increased activity in a brain network related to attention regulation, and (d) reduced activity in brain systems implicated in conceptual-linguistic self-view. MBSR-related changes in maladaptive or distorted social self-view in adults diagnosed with SAD may be related to modulation of conceptual self-processing and attention regulation. Self-referential processing may serve as a functional biobehavioral target to measure the effects of mindfulness training.},

  abstract = {It has long been known that pupils - the apertures that allow light into the eyes - dilate and constrict not only in response to changes in ambient light but also in response to emotional changes and arousing stimuli (e.g., Fontana, 1765). Charles Darwin (1872) related changes in pupil diameter to fear and other �emotions� in animals. For decades, pupillometry has been used to study cognitive processing across many domains, including perception, language, visual search, and short-term memory. Historically, such studies have examined the pupillary reflex as a correlate of attentional demands imposed by different tasks or stimuli - pupils typically dilate as cognitive demand increases. Because the neural mechanisms responsible for such task-evoked pupillary reflexes (TEPRs) implicate a role for memory processes, recent studies have examined pupillometry as a tool for investigating the cognitive processes underlying the creation of new episodic memories and their later retrieval. Here, we review the historical antecedents of current pupillometric research and discuss several recent studies linking pupillary dilation to the on-line consumption of cognitive resources in long-term-memory tasks. We conclude by discussing the future role of pupillometry in memory research and several methodological considerations that are important when designing pupillometric studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As computational power improves, the application of more advanced machine learning techniques to the analysis of large genome-wide association (GWA) datasets becomes possible. While most traditional statistical methods can only elucidate main effects of genetic variants on risk for disease, certain machine learning approaches are particularly suited to discover higher order and non-linear effects. One such approach is the Random Forests (RF) algorithm. The use of RF for SNP discovery related to human disease has grown in recent years; however, most work has focused on small datasets or simulation studies which are limited. RESULTS: Using a multiple sclerosis (MS) case-control dataset comprised of 300 K SNP genotypes across the genome, we outline an approach and some considerations for optimally tuning the RF algorithm based on the empirical dataset. Importantly, results show that typical default parameter values are not appropriate for large GWA datasets. Furthermore, gains can be made by sub-sampling the data, pruning based on linkage disequilibrium (LD), and removing strong effects from RF analyses. The new RF results are compared to findings from the original MS GWA study and demonstrate overlap. In addition, four new interesting candidate MS genes are identified, MPHOSPH9, CTNNA3, PHACTR2 and IL7, by RF analysis and warrant further follow-up in independent studies. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents one of the first illustrations of successfully analyzing GWA data with a machine learning algorithm. It is shown that RF is computationally feasible for GWA data and the results obtained make biologic sense based on previous studies. More importantly, new genes were identified as potentially being associated with MS, suggesting new avenues of investigation for this complex disease.},

Emerging evidence across multiple fields suggests that mindfulness is fundamentally connected to many aspects of workplace functioning, but this knowledge base has not been systematically integrated to date. This review coalesces the burgeoning body of mindfulness scholarship into a framework to guide mainstream management research investigating a broad range of constructs. The framework identifies how mindfulness influences attention, with downstream effects on functional domains of cognition, emotion, behavior, and physiology. Ultimately, these domains impact key workplace outcomes, including performance, relationships, and well-being. Consideration of the evidence on mindfulness at work stimulates important questions and challenges key assumptions within management science, generating an agenda for future research.}

The use of such standards to represent nursing knowledge, terminology, processes, and information in electronic health records will enhance continuity of care, decision support, and the exchange of comparable patient information. As part of this activity, working groups at the 2001, 2002, and 2003 Summit Conferences examined how to represent nursing information in the Health Level 7 (HL7) Reference Information Model (RIM).Design The working groups represented the nursing process as a dynamic sequence of phases, each containing information specific to the activities of the phase. They used Universal Modeling Language (UML) to represent this domain knowledge in models. An Activity Diagram was used to create a dynamic model of the nursing process. After creating a structural model of the information used at each stage of the nursing process, the working groups mapped that information to the HL7 RIM. They used a hierarchical structure for the organization of nursing knowledge as the basis for a hierarchical model for ``Findings about the patient.��? The modeling and mapping reported here were exploratory and preliminary, not exhaustive or definitive. The intent was to evaluate the feasibility of representing some types of nursing information consistently with HL7 standards.Measurements The working groups conducted a small-scale validation by testing examples of nursing terminology against the HL7 RIM class ``Observation.��?Results It was feasible to map patient information from the proposed models to the RIM class ``Observation.��? Examples illustrate the models and the mapping of nursing terminology to the HL7 RIM.Conclusion It is possible to model and map nursing information into the comprehensive health care information model, the HL7 RIM. These models must evolve and undergo further validation by clinicians. The integration of nursing information, terminology, and processes in information models is a first step toward rendering nursing information machine-readable in electronic patient records and messages. An eventual practical result, after much more development, would be to create computable, structured information for nursing documentation.}

The aim of this work is to demonstrate the scope and character of the activities that have been over years undertaken by the nursing community towards the development of the classification systems which are comparable with those used in medicine. The focus has been specifically put on the taxonomy of diagnosis used by the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) and the European International Classification of Nursing Practice (ICNP). The analysis of the reference sources constitutes the methodological foundation applied in this work. It has allowed to show the pioneering contribution of the American Nursing Association (ANA) into the process of recording and coding of the data that are essential in care delivery as well as their value for the development of ICNP. The latter one is a systematic and multi-axial structure which uses unified terminology and numeric codes for the three categories of variables: the recognized conditions, the undertaken activities and the achieved results.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: This paper discusses the reliance of numerical analysis on the concept of the standard deviation, and its close relative the variance. It suggests that the original reasons why the standard deviation concept has permeated traditional statistics are no longer clearly valid, if they ever were. The absolute mean deviation, it is argued here, has many advantages over the standard deviation. It is more efficient as an estimate of a population parameter in the real-life situation where the data contain tiny errors, or do not form a completely perfect normal distribution. It is easier to use, and more tolerant of extreme values, in the majority of real-life situations where population parameters are not required. It is easier for new researchers to learn about and understand, and also closely linked to a number of arithmetic techniques already used in the sociology of education and elsewhere. We could continue to use the standard deviation instead, as we do presently, because so much of the rest of traditional statistics is based upon it (effect sizes, and the F-test, for example). However, we should weigh the convenience of this solution for some against the possibility of creating a much simpler and more widespread form of numeric analysis for many.},

Comprehensive and Brief Core Sets have been defined for various disorders but not for sleep disorders. Such a Core Set would greatly enhance the techniques available to describe the impact of sleep disorders on patients. The overarching purpose of this paper is to report on phase 1 of the international and World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed consensus process in identifying ICF Core Sets for sleep disorders. METHODS A formal decision-making and consensus process which integrated evidence gathered from preparatory studies was carried out. Relevant ICF categories were selected by a sample of international experts from different backgrounds using the nominal group technique. RESULTS Twenty-six experts from 22 countries and different professional backgrounds attended the consensus conference. Altogether 120 second- or third-level ICF categories were included in the Comprehensive ICF Core Set with the following ICF component split: 49 categories from body functions, 8 from body structures, 31 from activities and participation and 32 from environmental factors. The Brief ICF Core Set included a total of 15 second-level categories: 5 body functions (sleep, energy and drive, attention, consciousness, respiration functions); 3 body structures (brain, respiratory system, pharynx); 4 activities and participation (focusing attention, driving, handling stress and other psychological demands, carrying out daily routine); and 3 environmental factors (immediate family; health services, systems, and policies; and health professionals). CONCLUSION A formal consensus process integrating evidence and expert opinion led to the first version of the ICF Core Sets for persons with sleep disorders. Further validation of the Core Set is needed.}

Conditions included: a) baseline-1: no task; b) concentration: attend exclusively to the calf; c) mindfulness: attend to the calf and observe, moment to moment, in a nonjudgmental manner; and d) baseline-2: no task.Results: Meditators required significantly higher temperatures to elicit moderate pain (meditators: 49.9\$\,\^∘\$C; controls: 48.2\$\,\^∘\$C; p = .01). While attending ``mindfully,��? meditators reported decreases in pain intensity whereas control subjects showed no change from baseline. The concentration condition resulted in increased pain intensity for controls but not for meditators. Changes in pain unpleasantness generally paralleled those found in pain intensity. In meditators, pain modulation correlated with slowing of the respiratory rate and with greater meditation experience. Covariance analyses indicated that mindfulness-related changes could be partially explained by changes in respiratory rates. Finally, the meditators reported higher tendencies to observe and be nonreactive of their own experience as measured on the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire; these factors correlated with individual differences in respiration.Conclusions: These results indicated that Zen meditators have lower pain sensitivity and experience analgesic effects during mindful states. Results may reflect cognitive/self-regulatory skills related to the concept of mindfulness and/or altered respiratory patterns. Prospective studies investigating the effects of meditative training and respiration on pain regulation are warranted.}

In light of these puzzling results, I propose that the relationship between extraversion and sales performance is not linear but curvilinear: Ambiverts achieve greater sales productivity than extraverts or introverts do. Because they naturally engage in a flexible pattern of talking and listening, ambiverts are likely to express sufficient assertiveness and enthusiasm to persuade and close a sale but are more inclined to listen to customers' interests and less vulnerable to appearing too excited or overconfident. A study of 340 outbound-call-center representatives supported the predicted inverted-U-shaped relationship between extraversion and sales revenue. This research presents a fresh perspective on the personality traits that facilitate successful influence and offers novel insights for people in choosing jobs and for organizations in hiring and training employees.},

In 5 experiments, participants received greedy, equal, or generous divisions of money or labor from an anonymous person and then divided additional resources with a new anonymous person. While equal treatment was paid forward in kind, greed was paid forward more than generosity. This asymmetry was driven by negative affect, such that a positive affect intervention disrupted the tendency to pay greed forward. Implications for models of generalized reciprocity are discussed.},

  abstract = {The therapeutic process involves many different types of affective phenomena. No single therapeutic perspective has been able to encompass within its own theoretical framework all the ways in which emotion plays a role in therapeutic change. A comprehensive, constructive theory of emotion helps transcend the differences in the therapeutic schools by viewing emotion as a complex synthesis of expressive motor, schematic, and conceptual information that provides organisms with information about their responses to situations that helps them orient adaptively in the environment. In addition to improved theory, increased precision in the assessment of affective functioning in therapy, as well as greater specification of different emotional change processes and means of facilitating these, will allow the role of emotion in change to be studied more effectively. A number of different change processes involving emotion are discussed, as well as principles of emotionally focused intervention that help access emotion and promote emotional restructuring.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To briefly review the effects of mindfulness on the mind, the brain, the body, and behavior. METHODS: Selective review of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar databases (2003-2008) using the terms "mindfulness", "meditation", "mental health", "physical health", "quality of life", and "stress reduction." A total of 52 exemplars of empirical and theoretical work were selected for review. RESULTS: Both basic and clinical research indicate that cultivating a more mindful way of being is associated with less emotional distress, more positive states of mind, and better quality of life. In addition, mindfulness practice can influence the brain, the autonomic nervous system, stress hormones, the immune system, and health behaviors, including eating, sleeping and substance use, in salutary ways. CONCLUSION: The application of cutting-edge technology toward understanding mindfulness - an "inner technology" - is elucidating new ways in which attention, awareness, acceptance, and compassion may promote optimal health - in mind, body, relationships, and spirit.},

In the wake of Bem's (2011) recent, highly publicized study on psi phenomena in a prestigious journal, psychologists are again raising serious questions about their dominant research script. These concerns are echoed in the current paper, and Observation Oriented Modeling (OOM) is presented as an alternative approach toward data conceptualization and analysis for the social and life sciences. This approach is rooted in philosophical realism and an attitude toward data analysis centered around causality and common sense. Three example studies and accompanying data analyses are presented and discussed to demonstrate a number of OOM's advantages over current researcher practices.},

Selected data from a recent study by Craig et al. were analyzed using Observation Oriented Modeling; this analysis was contrasted with a traditional repeated measures ANOVA assessment. Various pitfalls in traditional parametric analyses were avoided when using Observation Oriented Modeling, including the presence of outliers and missing data.

These methods grew out of a historic debate regarding the indeterminate nature of the common factor model. Unfortunately, most researchers are unaware of the indeterminacy issue and the problems associated with a number of the factor scoring procedures. This article reviews the history and nature of factor score indeterminacy. Novel computer programs for assessing the degree of indeterminacy in a given analysis, as well as for computing and evaluating different types of factor scores, are then presented and demonstrated using data from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--Third Edition. It is argued that factor score indeterminacy should be routinely assessed and reported as part of any exploratory factor analysis and that factor scores should be thoroughly evaluated before they are reported or used in subsequent statistical analyses.

METHODS Cross-sectional survey in a convenience sample of elderly patients requiring rehabilitation in an early post-acute rehabilitation facility. The second-level categories of the ICF were used to collect information on patients' problems. For the ICF components Body Functions, Body Structures and Activities and Participation, absolute and relative frequencies of impairments/limitations in the study population were reported. For the component Environmental Factors absolute and relative frequencies of perceived barriers or facilitators were reported. RESULTS The mean age in the sample was 79.9 years. Sixty-nine percent of the patients were female. In 150 patients, 82 ICF categories (34\%) had a prevalence of 30\% or above. The 82 categories included 22 categories (45\%) of the component Body Functions, six categories (15\%) of the component Body Structures, 25 categories (34\%) of the component Activities and Participation and 29 (57\%) categories of the component Environmental Factors.

METHODS A selection of 124 ICF categories was operation-alized in a formal decision-making and consensus process. The reliability of the newly operationalized item list was tested with a cross-sectional study with repeated measurements. RESULTS The item writing process resulted in 94 dichotomous and 30 polytomous items. Data were collected in a convenience sample of 28 patients with neurological, musculoske-letal, cardiopulmonary, or internal organ conditions, requiring physical therapy in an acute hospital. Fifty-six percent of the polytomous and 68\% of the dichotomous items had a raw agreement of 0.7 or above, whereas 36\% of all polytomous and 34\% of all dichotomous items had a kappa coefficient of 0.7 and above. CONCLUSION The study supports that the ICF is adaptable to professional and setting-specific needs of physiotherapists.

DESIGN Prospective multi-centre cohort study. PATIENTS Patients receiving rehabilitation interventions for musculoskeletal, neurological or cardiopulmonary injury or disease in acute hospitals. METHODS Functioning and contextual factors were coded using the ICF. The criterion for selecting candidate categories for the brief ICF Core Sets was based on their ability to discriminate between patients with high or low functioning status. Discrimination was assessed using multivariable regression models, the independent variables being all of the ICF categories of the respective comprehensive ICF Core Set. Analogue ratings of overall functioning as reported by patients and health professionals were used as dependent variables. RESULTS A total of 391 patients were included in the study (91 neurological, 109 cardiopulmonary, 191 musculoskeletal), mean age 63.4 years, 50.1\% female. Selection yielded 33 cate-gories for neurological, 31 for cardiopulmonary, and 30 for musculoskeletal.

Design: Prospective multi-centre cohort study. Patients: Patients receiving rehabilitation interventions for musculoskeletal, neurological or cardiopulmonary injury or disease in acute hospitals or early post-acute rehabilitation facilities. Methods: Functioning was coded using the ICF. For validation, absolute and relative frequencies (prevalences) of impairment, limitation or restriction were reported at admission and end-point (discharge or 6 weeks after admission). Aspects not covered were extracted and translated into the best corresponding ICF category. The criterion for selecting candidate categories for the brief ICF Core Sets was based on their ability to discriminate between patients with high or low functioning status. Discrimination was assessed using multivariable regression models, the independent variables being all of the ICF categories of the respective comprehensive ICF Core Set. Analogue ratings of overall functioning as reported by patients and health professionals were used as dependent variables. Conclusion: We present an algorithm to identify candidate categories for brief ICF Core Sets extracted from the comprehensive acute and post-acute ICF Core Sets.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the development, validity and application of a new instrument (PREPARED) for obtaining feedback from community consumers of discharge planning activities. DESIGN: Iterative qualitative and quantitative investigations. SETTING: The community catchment area of a metropolitan Australian tertiary public hospital. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged over 65 years, with a range of conditions, recently discharged from hospital, their carers, and hospital nursing staff. ACTIONS: PREPARED was constructed from interviews with patients, carers and hospital staff. It was trialed and modified to ensure sensitive measurement of key attributes of discharge planning process and outcome. This paper explores the patient and carer versions of PREPARED. Data items were reduced to domains of key questions by factor analysis. Instrument performance was assessed by correlation of process and outcome measures, by comparing PREPARED responses with subsequent unstructured interview data, and by testing whether PREPARED responses were independent of health-related quality of life at the time of survey. RESULTS: Four key process domains were identified: information exchange (community services and equipment), medication management, preparation for coping after discharge and control of discharge circumstances. Outcome was measured as overall satisfaction with discharge, whether equipment and community service needs had been met, use of health services and health related costs post-discharge. The instrument performed well when compared with interview data, the process and outcome domains were largely independent of each other, as were responses to PREPARED and SF-36. CONCLUSIONS: PREPARED offers a comprehensive way of closing the quality improvement loop, by providing information from the community perspective on the quality of planning for discharge from the acute hospital setting.},

Even without other incentives to be creative, romantic motives enhanced creativity on subjective and objective measures. For men, any cue designed to activate a short-term or a long-term mating goal increased creative displays; however, women displayed more creativity only when primed to attract a high-quality long-term mate. These creative boosts were unrelated to increased effort on creative tasks or to changes in mood or arousal. Furthermore, results were unaffected by the application of monetary incentives for creativity. These findings align with the view that creative displays in both sexes may be linked to sexual selection, qualified by unique exigencies of human parental investment.},

If so, they should vary strategically with manipulations of mating-related motives. The authors examined this possibility in 4 experiments. Inducing mating goals in men increased their willingness to spend on conspicuous luxuries but not on basic necessities. In women, mating goals boosted public--but not private--helping. Although mating motivation did not generally inspire helping in men, it did induce more helpfulness in contexts in which they could display heroism or dominance. Conversely, although mating motivation did not lead women to conspicuously consume, it did lead women to spend more publicly on helpful causes. Overall, romantic motives seem to produce highly strategic and sex-specific self-presentations best understood within a costly signaling framework.},

This study was undertaken to assess the construct validity and internal reliability of the previously developed Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ).Method---A total of 1390 patients from five practices in the North of England, the Midlands, and Scotland completed the questionnaire. Responses were checked for construct validity (including confirmatory factor analysis to check the factor structure of the scale) and internal reliability.Results---Confirmatory factor analysis showed that items loaded on the appropriate factors in a five factor model (doctors, nurses, access, appointments, and facilities). Scores on the specific subscales showed highly significant positive correlations with general satisfaction subscale scores suggesting construct validity. Also, the prediction (derived from past research) that older people would be more satisfied with the service was borne out by the results (F (4, 1312) = 57.10; p{$<$}0.0001), providing further construct validation. The five specific subscales (doctors, nurses, access, appointments, and facilities), the general satisfaction subscale, and the questionnaire as a whole were found to have high internal reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.74--0.95).Conclusion---The results suggest that the PSQ is a valid and internally reliable tool for assessing patient satisfaction with general practitioner services.

We argue that data analysis is primarily a procedure to build understanding, and as such, it dovetails with the cognitive processes of the human mind. Data analysis tasks closely resemble the cognitive process known as sensemaking. We demonstrate how data analysis is a sensemaking task adapted to use quantitative data. This identification highlights a universal structure within data analysis activities and provides a foundation for a theory of data analysis. The competing tensions of cognitive compatibility and scientific rigour create a series of problems that characterise the data analysis process. These problems form a useful organising model for the data analysis task while allowing methods to remain flexible and situation dependent. The insights of this model are especially helpful for consultants, applied statisticians and teachers of data analysis.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a structured group program that employs mindfulness meditation to alleviate suffering associated with physical, psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders. The program, nonreligious and nonesoteric, is based upon a systematic procedure to develop enhanced awareness of moment-to-moment experience of perceptible mental processes. The approach assumes that greater awareness will provide more veridical perception, reduce negative affect and improve vitality and coping. In the last two decades, a number of research reports appeared that seem to support many of these claims. We performed a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of published and unpublished studies of health-related studies related to MBSR. METHODS: Sixty-four empirical studies were found, but only 20 reports met criteria of acceptable quality or relevance to be included in the meta-analysis. Reports were excluded due to (1) insufficient information about interventions, (2) poor quantitative health evaluation, (3) inadequate statistical analysis, (4) mindfulness not being the central component of intervention, or (5) the setting of intervention or sample composition deviating too widely from the health-related MBSR program. Acceptable studies covered a wide spectrum of clinical populations (e.g., pain, cancer, heart disease, depression, and anxiety), as well as stressed nonclinical groups. Both controlled and observational investigations were included. Standardized measures of physical and mental well-being constituted the dependent variables of the analysis. RESULTS: Overall, both controlled and uncontrolled studies showed similar effect sizes of approximately 0.5 (P{$<$}.0001) with homogeneity of distribution. CONCLUSION: Although derived from a relatively small number of studies, these results suggest that MBSR may help a broad range of individuals to cope with their clinical and nonclinical problems.},

Studies suggest improvements in general aspects of well-being, including quality of life (QoL), coping and positive affect, as well as decreased anxiety and depression. METHODS: A quasi-experimental study examined effects of an 8-week MBSR intervention among 58 female patients with fibromyalgia (mean, 52 +/- 8 years) who underwent MBSR or an active social support procedure. Participants were assigned to groups by date of entry, and 6 subjects dropped out during the study. Self-report measures were validated German inventories and included the following scales: visual analog pain, pain perception, coping with pain, a symptom checklist and QoL. Pre- and postintervention measurements were made. Additionally, a 3-year follow-up was carried out on a subgroup of 26 participants. RESULTS: Pre- to postintervention analyses indicated MBSR to provide significantly greater benefits than the control intervention on most dimensions, including visual analog pain, QoL subscales, coping with pain, anxiety, depression and somatic complaints (Cohen d effect size, 0.40-1.10). Three-year follow-up analyses of MBSR participants indicated sustained benefits for these same measures (effect size, 0.50-0.65). CONCLUSIONS: Based upon a quasi-randomized trial and long-term observational follow-up, results indicate mindfulness intervention to be of potential long-term benefit for female fibromyalgia patients.},

Empirical comparisons of the accuracy of the two methods (136 studies over a wide range of predictands) show that the mechanical method is almost invariably equal to or superior to the clinical method: Common antiactuarial arguments are rebutted, possible causes of widespread resistance to the comparative research are offered, and policy implications of the statistical method's superiority are discussed.},

Here we present the circlize package, which provides an implementation of circular layout generation in R as well as an enhancement of available software. The flexibility of this package is based on the usage of low-level graphics functions such that self-defined high-level graphics can be easily implemented by users for specific purposes. Together with the seamless connection between the powerful computational and visual environment in R, circlize gives users more convenience and freedom to design figures for better understanding genomic patterns behind multi-dimensional data. Availability and implementation: circlize is available at the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/circlize/ CONTACT: b.brors@dkfz.de Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Given the extensive evidence base for the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), researchers have started to explore the mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effects on psychological outcomes, using methods of mediation analysis. No known studies have systematically reviewed and statistically integrated mediation studies in this field. The present study aimed to systematically review mediation studies in the literature on mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), to identify potential psychological mechanisms underlying MBCT and MBSR's effects on psychological functioning and wellbeing, and evaluate the strength and consistency of evidence for each mechanism. For the identified mechanisms with sufficient evidence, quantitative synthesis using two-stage meta-analytic structural equation modelling (TSSEM) was used to examine whether these mechanisms mediate the impact of MBIs on clinical outcomes. This review identified strong, consistent evidence for cognitive and emotional reactivity, moderate and consistent evidence for mindfulness, rumination, and worry, and preliminary but insufficient evidence for self-compassion and psychological flexibility as mechanisms underlying MBIs. TSSEM demonstrated evidence for mindfulness, rumination and worry as significant mediators of the effects of MBIs on mental health outcomes. Most reviewed mediation studies have several key methodological shortcomings which preclude robust conclusions regarding mediation. However, they provide important groundwork on which future studies could build.},

  abstract = {Circular layout is very useful to represent complicated information, especially for genomic data. It has advantages to visualize data with long axes or large amount of categories, described with different measurements. It is also effective to visualize relations between elements. Circos (http://circos.ca) is an extraordinarily cool tool to make such circular layout and it is broadly used in real applications, not just popular in Genomic but in a lot of other areas as well. It is not only a way to visualize data, but also enhances the representation of scientific results into a level of aesthetics. Therefore, most people call figures with circular layout as 'circos plot'. Here the circlize package 1 aims to implement Circos in R. One important advantage for the implementation in R is that R is an ideal environment which provides seamless connection between data analysis and data visualization. This package is not a front-end wrapper to generate configuration files for Circos, but completely coded in R style by using R's elegant statistical and graphic engine. We aim to keep the flexibility and configurability of Circos, also make the package more straightforward to use and enhance it to support more types of graphics.}

Prior work has not related individual differences in amygdala or subgenual AC activation with neuroticism. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate changes in blood oxygen level-dependent signal within the amygdala and subgenual AC associated with trait neuroticism in a nonclinical sample of 36 volunteers during an emotional conflict task. Neuroticism correlated positively with amygdala and subgenual AC activation during trials of high emotional conflict, compared with trials of low emotional conflict. The subscale of neuroticism that reflected the anxious form of neuroticism (N1) explained a greater proportion of variance within the observed clusters than the subscale of neuroticism that reflected the depressive form of neuroticism (N3). Using a task that is sensitive to individual differences in the detection of emotional conflict, the authors have provided a neural correlate of the link between neuroticism and anxiety and mood disorders. This effect was driven to a greater extent by the anxious relative to the depressive characteristics of neuroticism and may constitute vulnerability markers for anxiety-related disorders.},

Users perceive a system easier to use as they gain more knowledge and confidence through direct experience in using the system. Our research traced the link between system experience and ease of use via both positive (computer playfulness) and negative (computer anxiety) responses using a sample of 116 users of electronic spreadsheets. As expected, system experience was significantly related to perceived ease of use. Both computer playfulness and computer anxiety were found to be significant mediators of the effect that system experience has on ease of use. However, the effect was fully mediated only by computer anxiety, revealing that the negative side of user reaction is a more potent mechanism than the positive side. Moreover, the findings indicate that those interventions found to influence the mediating variable of computer anxiety should be used to effectively enhance ease of use perceptions.},

The focus of this article is on the role of ICTs in relation to people's ability to participate in society. It draws upon detailed qualitative research on single parent and young elderly households to explore what counts as experiences of inclusion or exclusion and the processes behind them. Dealing mainly, but not exclusively, with the more traditional ICTs of telephony and broadcasting, the article considers processes of self-exclusion as people have mixed evaluations of these technologies derived both from current circumstances and past experiences. It then looks beyond the acquisition of ICTs to show how other modes of access to these resources are important before reflecting upon the quality of experience of ICTs, not just in terms of the functionality on offer but also taking into account that technologies are themselves symbolic goods. Finally, and drawing on more recent research, the article asks what lessons might be learnt from these traditional ICTs when considering newly emerging ones like the internet.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Review of the literature reveals a need to develop a questionnaire that measures patient perceptions of factors impacting continuity of care following discharge from hospital. Such a measure has the potential to guide quality improvement initiatives related to continuity of care. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to develop and examine the psychometric properties of a measure that would meet this need, the Patient Continuity of Care Questionnaire (PCCQ). METHOD: The PCCQ was administered to 204 inpatients 4 weeks after discharge. The questionnaire was assessed by item and principal components analysis. Factors derived from principal components analysis were assessed for internal consistency and construct validity. RESULTS: A principal components analysis resulted in six subscales including perceptions of: (1) relationships with providers in hospital, (2) information transfer to patients, (3) relationships with providers in community, (4) management of written forms, (5) management of follow-up and (6) management of communication among providers. These subscales were internally consistent in our sample and demonstrated construct validity through correlations with other related constructs. CONCLUSION: This initial study supports the reliability and validity of the PCCQ for measuring patient perceptions of factors central to continuity of care. The questionnaire subscales correspond to the theoretical components of continuity of care that have been proposed in the literature, namely informational, relational and management continuity. The subscales may be of value for identifying problems in continuity of care and for evaluating interventions aimed at improving continuity of care for patients after hospital discharge.},

  abstract = {Langer’s theory of mindfulness proposes that a mindful person seeks out and produces novelty, is attentive to context, and is flexible in thought and behavior. In three independent studies, the factor structure of the Langer Mindfulness/Mindlessness Scale was examined. Confirmatory factor analysis failed to replicate the four-factor model and a subsequent exploratory factor analysis revealed the presence of a two-factor (mindfulness and mindlessness) solution. Study 2 demonstrated that the two factors assessed discrete constructs and were not merely products of acquiescence. Support was also found for a nine-item, one-factor model comprised solely of mindfulness items. On comparing models, Study 3 suggested the superiority of the one-factor mindfulness model. Finally, a preliminary investigation of the concurrent validity of the revised nine-item Langer Mindfulness/Mindlessness Scale is presented. The current article offers researchers a revised version of a mindfulness measure derived from a cognitive perspective.}

Rasch Item Response Theory (IRT) provides a methodology to examine the hierarchical structure, unidimensionality, and reproducibility of item positions (calibrations) along a scale. Data gathered on the 10-item Physical Functioning Scale (PF-10) from a large sample of Medical Outcomes Study patients (N = 3445) were used to examine the hierarchical order, unidimensionality, and reproducibility of item calibrations. Rasch-IRT analyses generated an empirical item hierarchy, confirmed the unidimensionality of the PF-10 for most patients, and established the reproducibility of item calibrations across patient populations and repeated tests. These findings support the content validity of the PF-10 as a measure of physical functioning and suggest that valid Rasch-IRT summary scores could be generated as an alternative to the current Likert summative scores. Unidimensionality and reproducibility of the item scale are essential prerequisites for the development of Rasch-based person measures of physical functioning that can be used across populations and over repeated tests.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract Background: Mindfulness may have an impact on the recovery process in patients who have suffered severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). In order to make an instrument for measuring mindfulness within the German speaking clinical community available, a short, easily usable scale and a cross-cultural adaptation is needed. Objectives: To validate the Langer Mindfulness Scale (LMS) with German-speaking patients with severe TBI and their relatives (healthy controls). Research design: In a prospective cohort study of patients with severe TBI, test–re-test interviews were carried out at 6-month intervals. Sample: A total of 225 participants responded to the first survey and 230 completed the second survey. Measures: LMS, self-report questions on personality, openness and attention, as well as health and clinical evaluations (including cognitive and behavioural assessments). Results: On the basis of factor analysis, principal component analysis and item response analysis, the initial 21-items were reduced to six items. The resulting unidimensional scale showed high internal consistency (α\,=\,0.82) and good test–re-test reliability (intra-class correlation for total score\,=\,0.46). External validity was confirmed for the entire sample. Conclusion: It was concluded that the German short form of the original LMS (MCS) is a valid and reliable measure of mindful creativity.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Background  Mindfulness presents a self-regulation tool allowing the individual to recognize and accept mental experiences. We chose to validate the short form of FMI called FMI-14, since it contains all aspects of the original long version and it can be used among various general population. Interests in including mindfulness techniques in medical and psychological fields has been increasing recently. Accordingly, it is important to validate FMI-14-Ar to help professionals living in the Arabic speaking countries. Thus, the main objective of this study was to validate the Arabic version of the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI-Ar) among a sample of Lebanese university students. Methods  This study is a cross-sectional one carried out between July and September 2021 and enrolling 363 Lebanese university students recruited through convenience sampling through several Lebanese universities. The questionnaire included socio-demographic characteristics and the following scales: Lebanese Anxiety Scale (LAS-10) to assess anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess depression and Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI) to assess mindfulness. To estimate categorical confirmatory factor analysis of the FMI scale the Mplus was used and SPSS software version 23 was used for data analysis. Results  Participants mean age was 22.65 ± 3.48 years, and the majority 61.7\% were females. The fit indices of the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the one-factor model of the FMI came out as follows: χ             2             /df= 218.33/77=2.83, RMSEA= 0.071 [0.060-0.082], CFI=0.92 and TLI= 0.90. The Cronbach’s alpha value for the total scale was excellent (0.92). Additionally, the FMI score was negatively associated with anxiety (r=-0.48; p{$<$}0.001) and depression (r=-0.51; p=0.001). Conclusion  All hypotheses (factor, convergent, and divergent validity) related to the FMI-Ar were verified in our study. Therefore, professionals can now benefit from the FMI-Ar, a suitable scale to measure mindfulness among Lebanese university students.}

  abstract = {The p-value has long been the figurehead of statistical analysis in biology, but its position is under threat. p is now widely recognized as providing quite limited information about our data, and as being easily misinterpreted. Many biologists are aware of p's frailties, but less clear about how they might change the way they analyse their data in response. This article highlights and summarizes four broad statistical approaches that augment or replace the p-value, and that are relatively straightforward to apply. First, you can augment your p-value with information about how confident you are in it, how likely it is that you will get a similar p-value in a replicate study, or the probability that a statistically significant finding is in fact a false positive. Second, you can enhance the information provided by frequentist statistics with a focus on effect sizes and a quantified confidence that those effect sizes are accurate. Third, you can augment or substitute p-values with the Bayes factor to inform on the relative levels of evidence for the null and alternative hypotheses; this approach is particularly appropriate for studies where you wish to keep collecting data until clear evidence for or against your hypothesis has accrued. Finally, specifically where you are using multiple variables to predict an outcome through model building, Akaike information criteria can take the place of the p-value, providing quantified information on what model is best. Hopefully, this quick-and-easy guide to some simple yet powerful statistical options will support biologists in adopting new approaches where they feel that the p-value alone is not doing their data justice.}

In contrast to controlled experiments or well-planned, experimental randomized clinical trials, observational studies are subject to a number of potential problems that may bias their results. METHODS: Some of the more important problems affecting observational studies are described and illustrated by examples. Additional information is provided with reference to a selection of the literature. RESULTS: Factors that may bias the results of observational studies can be broadly categorized as: selection bias resulting from the way study subjects are recruited or from differing rates of study participation depending on the subjects' cultural background, age, or socioeconomic status, information bias, measurement error, confounders, and further factors. CONCLUSIONS: Observational studies make an important contribution to medical knowledge. The main methodological problems can be avoided by careful study planning. An understanding of the potential pitfalls is important in order to critically assess relevant publications.},

  abstract = {Our ability to generate and collect data has been increasing rapidly. Not only are all of our business, scientific, and government transactions now computerized, but the widespread use of digital cameras, publication tools, and bar codes also generate data. On the collection side, scanned text and image platforms, satellite remote sensing systems, and the World Wide Web have flooded us with a tremendous amount of data. This explosive growth has generated an even more urgent need for new techniques and automated tools that can help us transform this data into useful information and knowledge. Like the first edition, voted the most popular data mining book by KD Nuggets readers, this book explores concepts and techniques for the discovery of patterns hidden in large data sets, focusing on issues relating to their feasibility, usefulness, effectiveness, and scalability. However, since the publication of the first edition, great progress has been made in the development of new data mining methods, systems, and applications. This new edition substantially enhances the first edition, and new chapters have been added to address recent developments on mining complex types of data- including stream data, sequence data, graph structured data, social network data, and multi-relational data. Whether you are a seasoned professional or a new student of data mining, this book has much to offer you: A comprehensive, practical look at the concepts and techniques you need to know to get the most out of real business data. Updates that incorporate input from readers, changes in the field, and more material on statistics and machine learning. Dozens of algorithms and implementation examples, all in easily understood pseudo-code and suitable for use in real-world, large-scale data mining projects.

  abstract = {Our recent work showed that self-trait judgment is associated with increased activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) in non-religious Chinese, but in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) in Chinese Christians. The current work further investigated neural substrates of self-referential processing in Chinese Buddhists. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned 14 Chinese Buddhists, while they conducted trait judgments of the self, Zhu Rongji (the former Chinese premier), Sakyamuni (the Buddhist leader) and Jesus (the Christian leader). We found that, relative to Zhu Rongji judgment, self-judgment in Buddhist participants failed to generate increased activation in the VMPFC but induced increased activations in the DMPFC/rostral anterior cingulate cortex, midcingulate and the left frontal/insular cortex. Self-judgment was also associated with decreased functional connectivity between the DMPFC and posterior parietal cortex compared with Zhu Rongji judgment. The results suggest that Buddhist doctrine of No-self results in weakened neural coding of stimulus self-relatedness in the VMPFC, but enhanced evaluative processes of self-referential stimuli in the DMPFC. Moreover, self-referential processing in Buddhists is characterized by monitoring the conflict between the doctrine of No-self and self-focus thinking during self-trait judgment.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of outpatient health facilities, health workers, patients and caretakers. SETTING: Primary health care facilities in every province of Afghanistan. Main outcome measure Numerical scale of client perceptions of service quality. RESULTS: Clients report relatively high levels of perceived quality in Afghanistan. Most of the variation that is explained relates specifically to the patient's interaction with the health worker and not to other health facility characteristics, such as cleanliness, infrastructure, service capacity and the presence of equipment or drugs. The strongest determinants of client-perceived quality identified are health worker thoroughness in taking patient histories, conducting physical examinations and communicating with patients. Being seen by a doctor and being from a household in the poorest quintile are also associated with higher perceived quality. For female patients, being seen by a female provider is associated with higher perceived quality, while for male patients time and money spent for travel to the health facility are negatively associated with perceived quality. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical quality and client perceived quality appear to be mutually reinforcing, and efforts to improve health worker performance in taking histories, conducting exams and communicating with patients are likely to increase client perceived quality in this setting. Client perceptions of service quality assume additional importance in Afghanistan, where the perceived legitimacy of the government may depend partially on its ability to convince the population that it can deliver essential health services.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}br/{$>$}In response to the need to support diverse and complex information requirements, nursing has developed a number of different terminology systems. The two main kinds of systems that have emerged are enumerative systems and combinatorial systems, although some systems have characteristics of both approaches. Differences in the structure and content of terminology systems, while useful at a local level, prevent effective wider communication, information sharing, integration of record systems, and comparison of nursing elements of healthcare information at a more global level. Formal nursing terminology systems present an alternative approach. This paper describes a number of recent initiatives and explains how these emerging approaches may help to augment existing nursing terminology systems and overcome their limitations through mediation. The development of formal nursing terminology systems is not an end in itself and there remains a great deal of work to be done before success can be claimed. This paper presents an overview of the key issues outstanding and provides recommendations for a way forward.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In order to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of users of ICNP, substantial revision has been made to the Beta 2 version of ICNP, culminating in the launch of ICNP Version 1 in 2005. In its revision of ICNP, the development team has followed a rigorous development process using current best practice in ontology development. The core of ICNP Version 1 is represented in the Web Ontology Language, the de facto standard ontology representation language. An ontology editor, Protégé, and other software tools have been used to support the process. The result is a robust terminological resource that can accommodate existing and emerging nursing terminologies and allow comparisons to be made between disparate nursing data. The revision has provided ICNP with a sustainable foundation that will a) facilitate further development and maintenance of ICNP and b) extend significantly its functionality.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade there has been a surge of empirical research investigating mental disorders as complex systems. In this paper, we investigate how to best make use of this growing body of empirical research and move the field toward its fundamental aims of explaining, predicting, and controlling psychopathology. We first review the contemporary philosophy of science literature on scientific theories and argue that fully achieving the aims of explanation, prediction, and control requires that we construct formal theories of mental disorders: theories expressed in the language of mathematics or a computational programming language. We then investigate three routes by which one can use empirical findings (i.e., data models) to construct formal theories: (a) using data models themselves as formal theories, (b) using data models to infer formal theories, and (c) comparing empirical data models to theory-implied data models in order to evaluate and refine an existing formal theory. We argue that the third approach is the most promising path forward and conclude by expanding on this approach, proposing a framework for theory construction that details how to best use empirical research to generate, develop, and test formal theories of mental disorders.}

Individuals may also engage in MBP through everyday life (informal practice) and dedicate specific time for MBP (formal practice).                                         Method                                The Mindfulness Adherence Questionnaire, a scale designed to assess quantity and quality of formal and informal MBP was evaluated. Study 1 used a cross-sectional design to examine internal reliability and construct validity (                 N                 \,=\,282). Study 2 examined test–retest reliability and sensitivity (                 N                 \,=\,55) during a 4-week mindfulness intervention.                                                        Results                                A nested-factor model showed adequate fit: MAQ items loaded on both the general factor (                 Practice                 ) and specific factors (                 Formal and Informal                 ). Discriminant validity analyses revealed the MAQ captured MBP adherence distinct from trait mindfulness.                 Quality                 of both formal and informal mindfulness practice was more strongly associated with higher levels of trait mindfulness than                 quantity                 . Changes in MAQ                 Quantity                 scores were observed over time.                                                        Conclusions               The MAQ is reliable and has a meaningful scale structure, may usefully distinguish both quality versus quantity and formal versus informal MBP, and is sensitive to variations in MBP and does not solely measure trait mindfulness.},

Further, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has proposed a rule that would require facilities to computerize MDS data and submit it to state and federal agencies, paving the way for a national database. This article describes the process of testing the reliability of the MDS items in 13 nursing homes in five states. The results demonstrate that MDS data gathered in a research effort attain reliabilities that make such data useful. MDS items met a standard for excellent reliability (i.e., intraclass correlation of .7 or higher) in key areas of functional status, such as cognition, ADLs, continence, and diagnoses. Sixty-three percent of the items achieved reliability coefficients of .6 or higher. Eighty-nine percent of the items in the MDS achieved .4 or higher.}

A wide range of research is reviewed showing that many forms of psychopathology can be conceptualized as unhealthy efforts to escape and avoid emotions, thoughts, memories, and other private experiences. It is argued that experiential avoidance, as a functional diagnostic dimension, has the potential to integrate the efforts and findings of researchers from a wide variety of theoretical paradigms, research interests, and clinical domains and to lead to testable new approaches to the analysis and treatment of behavioral disorders.},

  abstract = {Based on the theory that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is maintained through a reactive and fused relationship with one's internal experiences and a tendency towards experiential avoidance and behavioral restriction, an acceptance-based behavior therapy (ABBT) was developed to specifically target these elements. Since ABBT has been shown to be an efficacious treatment in previous studies, the current study focuses on proposed mechanisms of change over the course of therapy. Specifically, the current study focuses on session-by-session changes in two proposed mechanisms of change: acceptance of internal experiences and engagement in meaningful activities. Overall, clients receiving ABBT reported an increase in the amount of time spent accepting internal experiences and engaging in valued activities. Change in both acceptance and engagement in meaningful activities was related to responder status at post-treatment and change in these two proposed mechanisms predicted outcome above and beyond change in worry. In addition, change in acceptance was related to reported quality of life at post-treatment. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Cronbach’s alpha (α) is a widely-used measure of reliability used to quantify the amount of random measurement error that exists in a sum score or average generated by a multi-item measurement scale. Yet methodologists have warned that α is not an optimal measure of reliability relative to its more general form, McDonald’s omega (ω). Among other reasons, that the computation of ω is not available as an option in many popular statistics programs and requires items loadings from a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) have probably hindered more widespread adoption. After a bit of discussion of α versus ω, we illustrate the computation of ω using two structural equation modeling programs (Mplus and AMOS) and the MBESS package for R. We then describe a macro for SPSS and SAS (OMEGA) that calculates ω in two ways without relying on the estimation of loadings or error variances using CFA. We show that it produces estimates of ω that are nearly identical to when using CFA-based estimates of item loadings and error variances. We also discuss the use of the OMEGA macro for certain forms of item analysis and brief form construction based on the removal of items from a longer scale.}

  abstract = {Social media have been adopted by many businesses. More and more companies are using social media tools such as Facebook and Twitter to provide various services and interact with customers. As a result, a large amount of user-generated content is freely available on social media sites. To increase competitive advantage and effectively assess the competitive environment of businesses, companies need to monitor and analyze not only the customer-generated content on their own social media sites, but also the textual information on their competitors' social media sites. In an effort to help companies understand how to perform a social media competitive analysis and transform social media data into knowledge for decision makers and e-marketers, this paper describes an in-depth case study which applies text mining to analyze unstructured text content on Facebook and Twitter sites of the three largest pizza chains: Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza and Papa John's Pizza. The results reveal the value of social media competitive analysis and the power of text mining as an effective technique to extract business value from the vast amount of available social media data. Recommendations are also provided to help companies develop their social media competitive analysis strategy. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  date = {1996},
  abstract = {A new method is presented for performing rapid and accurate numerical estimation. The method is derived from an area of human cognitive psychology called preattentive process-ing. Preattentive processing refers to an initial organization of the visual field based on cognitive operations believed to be rapid, automatic, and spatially parallel. Examples of visual features that can be detected in this way include hue, intensity, orientation, size, and motion. We believe that studies from preattentive vision should be used to assist in the de-sign of visualization tools, especially those for which high speed target detection, boundary identification, and region detection are important. In our present study, we investigated two known preattentive features (hue and orientation) in the context of a new task (numerical estimation) in order to see whether preattentive estimation was possible. Our experiments tested displays that were designed to visualize data from salmon migration simulations. The results showed that rapid and accurate estimation was indeed possible using either hue or orientation. Furthermore, random variation in one of these features resulted in no inter-ference when subjects estimated the percentage of the other. To test the generality of our results, we varied two important display parameters, display duration and feature differ-ence, and found boundary conditions for each. Implications of our results for application to real-word data and tasks are discussed.},

  abstract = {Adolescence is a time that can set the course of alcohol abuse later in life. Sensitivity to reward on multiple levels is a major factor in this development. We examined 736 adolescents from the IMAGEN longitudinal study for alcohol drinking during early (mean age=14.37) and again later (mean age=16.45) adolescence. Conducting structural equation modeling we evaluated the contribution of reward-related personality traits, behavior, brain responses and candidate genes. Personality seems to be most important in explaining alcohol drinking in early adolescence. However, genetic variations in ANKK1 (rs1800497) and HOMER1 (rs7713917) play an equal role in predicting alcohol drinking two years later and are most important in predicting the increase in alcohol consumption. We hypothesize that the initiation of alcohol use may be driven more strongly by personality while the transition to increased alcohol use is more genetically influenced.},

In particular, the high variance in the object of study (i.e., humans) prevents the use of Popper's falsification principle (which is the norm in other sciences). Therefore, the desirability of quantitative psychological models must be assessed by measuring the capacity of the model to fit empirical data. In the present paper, an error measure (likelihood), as well as five methods to compare model fits (the likelihood ratio test, Akaike's information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion, bootstrapping and cross-validation), are presented. The use of each method is illustrated by an example, and the advantages and weaknesses of each method are also discussed. The},

  abstract = {It has been suggested that mindfulness is a predictive factor in self-reported perceived stress. The present study aimed to investigate the link between mindful attention awareness, perceived stress and subjective wellbeing without the presence of a complementary intervention to promote mindfulness-based strategies. Methods: The online survey participants (N = 257) were university students enrolled in initial teacher training. Self-report measures included the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI). Results: PWI was negatively correlated with PSS (r = −0.550, p = .001), MAAS was negatively correlated with PSS (r = −0.567, p = .001) and positively correlated with PWI (r = 0.336, p = .001). The mean score for PSS (M = 20.61, SD = 6.62) was above the reported norm (14.2). Conclusions: The findings suggest that higher levels of mindful attention awareness may be associated with lower levels of perceived stress and higher subjective wellbeing levels and lower levels of perceived stress may be associated with higher subjective wellbeing. The findings confirm that pre-service teachers are a demographic that experiences elevated levels of perceived stress regardless of the stage in initial teacher training programs.},

  abstract = {Low birth weight (LBW) infants have lower infant mortality in groups in which LBW is most frequent. For example, in 1991, US infants born to smokers had higher risks of both LBW and infant mortality than infants born to nonsmokers. However, among LBW infants, infant mortality was lower for infants born to smokers (relative rate = 0.79). There are competing theories regarding this so-called "paradox." One is that maternal smoking is beneficial for LBW infants. The authors use causal diagrams to show that, even in the absence of any beneficial effect of smoking, an inverse association due to stratification on birth weight can be found. This variable is affected by the exposure of interest and shares common causes with the outcome. That is, LBW infants born to smokers may have a lower risk of mortality than other LBW infants whose LBW is due to causes associated with high mortality (e.g., birth defects). Under realistic causal diagrams, adjustment for birth weight is unwarranted when the analytical goal is to estimate overall effects of prenatal variables on infant mortality. Even for estimating direct effects of prenatal variables, adjustment for birth weight may be invalid when there is an unmeasured common cause of LBW and mortality. An appropriate justification for conditioning on birth weight requires specifying 1) the causal question motivating this analytical approach and 2) the assumptions regarding the proposed underlying biologic mechanisms.},

We also examine the relationships between Eysenck's PEN and revised RST factors. Two hundred and twelve participants completed Carver and White's BIS/BAS scales and Eysenck's Personality Questionnaire-Revised. Confirmatory factor analyses of the original BIS scale showed that the hypothesized two-factor model of BIS-Anxiety and FFFS-Fear was the best fit to these data. Associations between the revised RST and Eysenck's PEN were examined using path analysis. In line with theoretical predictions, Psychoticism was related to revised BIS-Anxiety and BAS, Neuroticism to revised BIS-Anxiety and FFFS-Fear, and extraversion to BAS and FFFS-Fear. Distinctions between BAS subscales and their associations to BIS, N and P were made in terms of past, present and future focus. Possible explanations for mixed findings in the literature and implications for future research are discussed.},

  abstract = {The standard model of labor is one in which individuals trade their time and energy in return for monetary rewards. Building on Fiske's relational theory (1992), we propose that there are two types of markets that determine relationships between effort and payment: monetary and social. We hypothesize that monetary markets are highly sensitive to the magnitude of compensation, whereas social markets are not. This perspective can shed light on the well-established observation that people sometimes expend more effort in exchange for no payment (a social market) than they expend when they receive low payment (a monetary market). Three experiments support these ideas. The experimental evidence also demonstrates that mixed markets (markets that include aspects of both social and monetary markets) more closely resemble monetary than social markets.},

PCM is needed in Escherichia coli for maximal long-term survival when exposed to oxidative stress, osmotic stress, repeated heat stress or methanol. The effect of pH on a pcm mutant during long-term stationary phase was examined. PCM was not required for long-term survival of E. coli subjected to pH stress alone; however, PCM-deficient cells showed impaired resistance to paraquat and methanol only at elevated pH. The mutant also showed stress-survival phenotypes in minimal medium buffered to pH 9.0. Accumulation of isoaspartyl residues was accelerated at pH 8.0 or 9.0 in vivo, though PCM-deficient cells did not show higher levels of damage. However, the pcm mutant displayed an extended lag phase in recovering from stationary phase at pH 9.0. Protein repair by PCM thus plays a key role in long-term stress survival only at alkaline pH in E. coli, and it may function primarily to repair damage in cells that are recovering from nutrient limitation and in those cells that are able to divide during long-term stationary phase.},

The distribution of the measures does not align with the distribution of the item measures in the original Grasmick et al. scale. The items do not fit the Rasch model, they do not form a unidimensional trait, and they function differently for males and females.

Therefore, it is important to find the determinants that make primary care more attractive, and which support GPs remaining in practice. Our aim in this exploratory study was to search for relevant GP subgroups and their characteristics in order to find starting points for improvements or interventions. We attempted a comprehensive survey of all GPs in the German region of Siegen-Wittgenstein with about 280,000 inhabitants. There were 158 GPs in the total population; 85 of these (53.8\%) took part in the study. There were 64 male GPs (75.3\%) in our sample. The mean age of the participants was 53.5 years (SD 8.93). The questionnaire was composed of demographic questions, questions regarding future perspectives, the Motivation for Medical Education Questionnaire (MoME-Q), the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), and the Work Satisfaction Questionnaire. K-means cluster analyses were used for subgrouping. A 2-cluster solution had good statistical quality criteria. Cluster 1 was characterised by elderly GPs who more frequently had a resident physician in their practices. These GPs had low burnout scores and high work satisfaction scores. Cluster 2 consisted of younger GPs who less frequently had a resident in their practices. They had average burnout scores according to published norms and lower work satisfaction scores. There seems to be an age cohort effect regarding burnout and work satisfaction. Having a resident physician seems to be protective. Interventions should be designed for younger GPs, especially members of generation Y, to reduce burnout and improve work satisfaction.},

We were interested in the feasibility and validity of profiling based on funnel plots and mixed effect models for the surveillance of German ambulatory care physicians' prescribing. We analyzed prescriptions issued to patients with a health insurance card attending neurologists' and psychiatrists' ambulatory practices in the German federal state of Saarland. The German National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians developed a prescribing assessment scheme (PAS) which contains a systematic appraisal of the benefit of drugs for so far 12 different indications. The drugs have been classified on the basis of their clinical evidence as standard, reserve or third level medication. We had 152.583 prescriptions in 56 practices available for analysis. A total of 38.796 patients received these prescriptions. The funnel plot approach with additive correction for overdispersion was almost equivalent to a mixed effects model which directly took the multilevel structure of the data into account. In the first case three practices were labeled as outliers, the mixed effects model resulted in two outliers. We suggest that both techniques should be routinely applied within a surveillance system of prescription claims data.}

In a recent study of our research group using confirmatory factor analysis, we modeled positive and negative emotion as well as emotion regulation skills along with the classical ADHD-core symptoms. We showed that negative affect and the failure to apply adaptive emotion regulation skills were distinct and indicative dimensions in adult ADHD. In this study, we used a person-centered approach based on cluster analysis to subtype patients on the presence or relative absence of ERD. This results in important information to individualize treatment decisions. We found two clusters, with cluster 2 showing high ERD that were associated with higher impairments indicated by depressive mood, negative affect and elevated psychological distress. There were also higher rates of comorbidity in cluster 2 such as somatoform disorders which were associated with ERD. Women were overrepresented in this cluster 2. Neuropsychological variables did not contribute significantly to cluster formation. In conclusion, ADHD in adults is a heterogeneous disorder with specific subgroups that need differential treatment approaches.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The provision of healthcare has to take into consideration evidence-based results from valid and relevant studies; this principle is included in German social laws. The prescribing assessment scheme (PAS) of the German National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians contains a systematic appraisal of the benefit of drugs on the basis of their clinical evidence, their safety, and indications for their prescription. METHODS We analysed nationwide prescription data of physicians that have contractual relationships with statutory health insurance funds in 2014. The drugs have been classified on the basis of their clinical evidence as standard, reserve or third level medication. We report proportions of prescriptions in the first and third priority levels of the PAS in primary care, cardiology, and neurology/psychiatry as their prescriptions have a high correspondence with the PAS. RESULTS The proportion in the first priority in primary care was more than two-thirds of the total prescriptions. The highest proportion in this category was observed in Bremen; the lowest proportions were found in the new federal states. In cardiology, the first priority was chosen in 54\%, in neurology/psychiatry in about 41\% of prescriptions (DDDs). The proportion of the third priority is with one-fifth highest in cardiology, with 16\%, lowest in primary care; neurology/psychiatry takes a middle position with 17.7\%. CONCLUSIONS Prescriptions predominantly conformed with the first priority of the PAS. There were variations across disciplines and regions (federal states). The PAS offers an opportunity to connect quality and indication in the prescription process. HINTERGRUND Die medizinische Versorgung hat sich an der Evidenz aus validen und relevanten Studien zu orientieren; dieses Prinzip ist in Deutschland sozialrechtlich normiert. Der Medikationskatalog der Kassenärztlichen Bundesvereinigung bietet für mehrere Verordnungsgebiete eine systematische Klassifizierung von Medikamenten nach der zugrundeliegenden Studienevidenz, der Sicherheit und des indikationsgerechten Einsatzes der entsprechenden Substanz. METHODIK Die Auswertungen beruhen auf den Arzneiverordnungsdaten nach 300 SGB V des Jahres 2014. Die jeweiligen Substanzen sind als Standard (1. Priorität), Reserve (2. Priorität) oder nachrangig zu verordnen (3. Priorität) eingestuft. Es werden die Anteile an den Verordnungen der 1. und 3. Prioritäten des Medikationskataloges bei den Fachgruppen der Hausärzte, der Kardiologen und der Neurologen/Psychiater/Nervenärzte berichtet, da deren Verordnungen eine hohe Abdeckung durch den Medikationskatalog aufweisen. ERGEBNISSE Insgesamt liegt der Anteil bei den Hausärzten in der 1. Priorität bei etwas mehr als zwei Dritteln. Den höchsten Anteil der Kategorie 1 hat Bremen; die niedrigsten Anteile finden sich in den neuen Bundesländern. In der kardiologischen Versorgung macht die Priorität 1 ca. 54\%, in der neurologisch-psychiatrischen Versorgung ca. 41\% der Verordnungen (DDDs) aus. Der Anteil der Priorität 3 ist in der Kardiologie mit einem Fünftel der Verordnungen am höchsten, bei den Hausärzten mit 16\% am niedrigsten; die neurologisch-psychiatrische Versorgung nimmt mit 17.7\% eine mittlere Position ein. SCHLUSSFOLGERUNGEN Überwiegend entsprechen die analysierten Verordnungen der Priorität 1 des Medikationskatalogs. Dabei ergeben sich jedoch Variationen nach Fachgebieten und Regionen (Ländern). Der Medikationskatalog bietet die Chance, die Perspektiven von Qualität und indikationsgerechtem Einsatz zu verbinden.}

  abstract = {Children are in the midst of a vast, unplanned experiment, surrounded by digital technologies that were not available but 5 years ago. At the apex of this boom is the introduction of applications (“apps”) for tablets and smartphones. However, there is simply not the time, money, or resources available to evaluate each app as it enters the market. Thus, “educational” apps—the number of which, as of January 2015, stood at 80,000 in Apple’s App Store (Apple, 2015)—are largely unregulated and untested. This article offers a way to define the potential educational impact of current and future apps. We build upon decades of work on the Science of Learning, which has examined how children learn best. From this work, we abstract a set of principles for two ultimate goals. First, we aim to guide researchers, educators, and designers in evidence-based app development. Second, by creating an evidence-based guide, we hope to set a new standard for evaluating and selecting the most effective existing children’s apps. In short, we will show how the design and use of educational apps aligns with known processes of children’s learning and development and offer a framework that can be used by parents and designers alike. Apps designed to promote active, engaged, meaningful, and socially interactive learning—four “pillars” of learning—within the context of a supported learning goal are considered educational.},

Fifteen Vipassana meditators (mean practice: 7.9 years, 2h daily) and fifteen non-meditators, matched for sex, age, education, and handedness, participated in a block-design fMRI study that included mindfulness of breathing and mental arithmetic conditions. For the meditation condition (contrasted to arithmetic), meditators showed stronger activations in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex bilaterally, compared to controls. Greater rostral anterior cingulate cortex activation in meditators may reflect stronger processing of distracting events. The increased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex may reflect that meditators are stronger engaged in emotional processing.},

However, there are indications of differences between the original MAAS and a version with the positively rephrased MAAS items (“mirror items”). The present study examines whether the mindfulness facet “mindful attention and awareness” (MAA) can be measured with both positively and negatively worded items if we take method effects due to item wording into account. To this end, the 15 negatively worded items of the MAAS and additionally 13 positively rephrased items were assessed ( N = 602). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) models with and without regard to method effects were carried out and evaluated by means of model fit. As a result, the positively and negatively worded items should be seen as different methods that influence the construct validity of mindfulness. Furthermore, a modified version of the MAAS (MAAS-Short) with five negatively worded items (taken from the MAAS) and five positively worded items (“mirror items”) was introduced as an alternative to assess MAA. The MAAS-Short appears superior to the original MAAS. The results and the limitations of the present study are discussed.},

  abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is undoubtedly the most common inferential technique used to justify claims in the social sciences. However, even staunch defenders of NHST agree that its outcomes are often misinterpreted. Confidence intervals (CIs) have frequently been proposed as a more useful alternative to NHST, and their use is strongly encouraged in the APA Manual. Nevertheless, little is known about how researchers interpret CIs. In this study, 120 researchers and 442 students—all in the field of psychology—were asked to assess the truth value of six particular statements involving different interpretations of a CI. Although all six statements were false, both researchers and students endorsed, on average, more than three statements, indicating a gross misunderstanding of CIs. Self-declared experience with statistics was not related to researchers’ performance, and, even more surprisingly, researchers hardly outperformed the students, even though the students had not received any education on statistical inference whatsoever. Our findings suggest that many researchers do not know the correct interpretation of a CI. The misunderstandings surrounding p-values and CIs are particularly unfortunate because they constitute the main tools by which psychologists draw conclusions from data.},

Using voxel-based morphometry, this study investigated MRI brain images of 20 mindfulness (Vipassana) meditators (mean practice 8.6 years; 2 h daily) and compared the regional gray matter concentration to that of non-meditators matched for sex, age, education and handedness. Meditators were predicted to show greater gray matter concentration in regions that are typically activated during meditation. Results confirmed greater gray matter concentration for meditators in the right anterior insula, which is involved in interoceptive awareness. This group difference presumably reflects the training of bodily awareness during mindfulness meditation. Furthermore, meditators had greater gray matter concentration in the left inferior temporal gyrus and right hippocampus. Both regions have previously been found to be involved in meditation. The mean value of gray matter concentration in the left inferior temporal gyrus was predictable by the amount of meditation training, corroborating the assumption of a causal impact of meditation training on gray matter concentration in this region. Results suggest that meditation practice is associated with structural differences in regions that are typically activated during meditation and in regions that are relevant for the task of meditation.},

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), one of the most widely used mindfulness training programs, has been reported to produce positive effects on psychological well-being and to ameliorate symptoms of a number of disorders. Here, we report a controlled longitudinal study to investigate pre-post changes in brain gray matter concentration attributable to participation in an MBSR program. Anatomical magnetic resonance (MR) images from 16 healthy, meditation-naïve participants were obtained before and after they underwent the 8-week program. Changes in gray matter concentration were investigated using voxel-based morphometry, and compared with a waiting list control group of 17 individuals. Analyses in a priori regions of interest confirmed increases in gray matter concentration within the left hippocampus. Whole brain analyses identified increases in the posterior cingulate cortex, the temporo-parietal junction, and the cerebellum in the MBSR group compared with the controls. The results suggest that participation in MBSR is associated with changes in gray matter concentration in brain regions involved in learning and memory processes, emotion regulation, self-referential processing, and perspective taking.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors contributing most to variability in patient experience in order to present approaches for fairer benchmarking of hospitals and for quality improvement. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data from a widely used survey on patient experience. SETTING: Inpatients from all 24 acute hospitals in the Canton of Bern in Switzerland. Data collection followed the standardized and validated Picker Institute methodology for a period of 13 weeks in the fall/winter of 2005. PARTICIPANTS: Inpatients age 18 years and older (n = 14 089), discharged within the sampling period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 'Patient experience', measured by the total Picker Problem Score (PPS) and by six domain scores (care, communication, respect, cooperation, organization, discharge management). RESULTS: In regression analysis, the patient factors self-reported health, age and education explained the highest proportion of variability in the PPS (4.8, 2.2 and 0.7 per cent, respectively). Multiple linear adjustment for factors associated with patients removed between 29 and 33 per cent of variability between hospital categories. The domain score means varied from under 5 per cent for 'respect towards the patient' to 34 per cent for 'discharge management'. Ranking of hospitals by domain scores differed from the ranking based on the total PPS. CONCLUSIONS: Statistical adjustment for patient mix and additional stratification for some hospital factors make benchmarking using patient survey data fairer and more transparent. Use of our approach for presenting quality data may make interpretation easier for the different target groups and may enhance the relevance of such information for decision-making. [Abstract]},

In this paper, we examined the ICNP Version 1.0 and identified the changes from the Beta 2 Version. A major change was the use of new technology for development of the ICNP Version 1.0 using description logics. Another change to the new version is the single classification structure that was refined into representation of a 7 Axis Model. The new coding system and new guidelines for composing statements that were developed using an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standard are also discussed.},

This paper discusses ways to provide a practical foundation for students to learn to "compute with data" as defined by Nolan and Temple Lang (2010), as well as develop "data habits of mind" (Finzer, 2013). We describe how introductory and second courses can integrate two key precursors to data science: the use of reproducible analysis tools and access to large databases. By introducing students to commonplace tools for data management, visualization, and reproducible analysis in data science and applying these to real-world scenarios, we prepare them to think statistically in the era of big data.},

  abstract = {Confusion over the reporting and interpretation of results of commonly employed classical statistical tests is recorded in a sample of 1,645 papers from 12 psychology journals for the period 1990 through 2002. The confusion arises because researchers mistakenly believe that their interpretation is guided by a single unified theory of statistical inference. But this is not so: classical statistical testing is a nameless amalgamation of the rival and often contradictory approaches developed by Ronald Fisher, on the one hand, and Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson, on the other. In particular, there is extensive failure to acknowledge the incompatibility of Fisher's evidential pvalue with the Type I error rate, *, of Neyman--Pearson statistical orthodoxy. The distinction between evidence (p's) and errors (*'s) is not trivial. Rather, it reveals the basic differences underlying Fisher's ideas on significance testing and inductive inference, and Neyman--Pearson views on hypothesis testing and inductive behavior. So complete is this misunderstanding over measures of evidence versus error that it is not viewed as even being a problem among the vast majority of researchers and other relevant parties. These include the APA Task Force on Statistical Inference, and those writing the guidelines concerning statistical testing mandated in APA Publication Manuals. The result is that, despite supplanting Fisher's significance-testing paradigm some fifty years or so ago, recognizable applications of Neyman--Pearson theory are few and far between in psychology's empirical literature. On the other hand, Fisher's influence is ubiquitous.},

  abstract = {Reporting p values from statistical significance tests is common in psychology's empirical literature. Sir Ronald Fisher saw the p value as playing a useful role in knowledge development by acting as an 'objective' measure of inductive evidence against the null hypothesis. We review several reasons why the p value is an unobjective and inadequate measure of evidence when statistically testing hypotheses. A common theme throughout many of these reasons is that p values exaggerate the evidence against H0. This, in turn, calls into question the validity of much published work based on comparatively small, including .05, p values. Indeed, if researchers were fully informed about the limitations of the p value as a measure of evidence, this inferential index could not possibly enjoy its ongoing ubiquity. Replication with extension research focusing on sample statistics, effect sizes, and their confidence intervals is a better vehicle for reliable knowledge development than using p values. Fisher would also have agreed with the need for replication research.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Medical communication can be a stressful experience for both doctors and patients. In particular, inexperienced doctors facing the demanding task of a bad news consultation may experience high levels of distress. The aim of this exploratory study is to test students' differential cardiovascular reactivity to history taking and bad news consultations with a simulated patient, and to test the relation between the students' self-reported stressfulness of the consultation and their cardiovascular response. METHODS: Fourth and fifth year medical students (n=20) conducted a history taking (HT) and a bad news (BN) consultation in a randomized order with a standardized patient. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were assessed by way of the Finapres-technique in four conditions: rest, reading aloud, and during both consultations. Self-reported stress was assessed before and after each interview using the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and a visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: Both HT and BN provoked more cardiovascular stress than reading. Bad-news provoked the highest HR and CO responses compared to all other conditions, and had a greater impact when it was the student's first consultation. The STAI and VAS data showed some correlations with the cardiovascular stress measures and a comparable but less significant pattern in stress response. DISCUSSION: The effect of order of the HT and BN consultations on the students' stress levels suggests an additional impact of novelty and habituation. Unfamiliarity with the patient may enhance the stressfulness of the task of breaking bad news.},

  abstract = {Problem-based learning (PBL) is perhaps the most innovative instructional method conceived in the his- tory of education. PBL was originally designed to respond to the criticism that traditional teaching and learning methods fail to prepare medical students for solving problems in clinical settings. Instead of requir- ing that students study content knowledge and then practice context-free problems, PBL embeds students' learning processes in real-life problems. After its suc- cessful implementation in various fields of medical education, PBL is now being implemented throughout higher education as well as in K--12 education. The purpose of this chapter is to inform researchers and practitioners about research findings and issues in PBL that may be used to inform future studies. In this chap- ter, we review PBL research from the past 30 years. We first describe the history of development and imple- mentation of PBL in various educational settings and define the major characteristics of PBL. We then review the research on PBL. First, we examine the effective- ness of PBL in terms of student learning outcomes, including basic domain knowledge acquisition and applications, retention of content and problem-solving skills, higher order thinking, self-directed learning/life- long learning, and self-perception. Second, we look at implementation issues, such as tutoring issues, curric- ulum design issues, and use of technology. Finally, we provide recommendations for future research.},

It introduces the concept of identification thoroughly and clearly and discusses it as a process of trying to isolate variation that has a causal interpretation. Subjects include heavy emphasis on data-generating processes and causal diagrams. Concepts are demonstrated with a heavy emphasis on graphical intuition and the question of what we do to data.

Just because algorithms are based on code doesn't mean experiments are easily replicated. Far from it.

That is leading to a new conscientiousness about research methods and publication protocols. Last week, at a meeting of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in New Orleans, Louisiana, reproducibility was on the agenda, with some teams diagnosing the problem—and one laying out tools to mitigate it.

Red-green confusion people do not confuse all kinds of red and all kinds of green. By selecting particular hues for each color, the ability to distinguish between the four colors should be greatly improved. Our study thus concluded that, by carefully selecting hues within the range of each color category, it is possible to establish color-combinations which are easily distinguishable to people of all color-vision types in order to facilitate visual communication.},

  abstract = {Objective: Response-shift has been cited as an important measurement consideration when assessing patient reported quality of life (QoL) outcomes over time among patients with severe chronic conditions. Here we report the results of a systematic review of response shift in studies assessing QoL among cancer patients.Methods: A systematic review using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsychINFO along with a manual search of the cited references of the articles selected, was conducted. A quality review was performed using STROBE criteria and reported according to PRISMA guidelines.Results: A systematic review of 1,487 records published between 1,887 and December 2018 revealed 104 potentially eligible studies, and 35 studies met inclusion criteria for content and quality. The most common cancer patient populations investigated in these studies were breast (18 studies), lung (14 studies), prostate (eight studies), and colorectal (eight studies). Response shift was identified among 34 of the 35 studies reviewed. Effect sizes were reported in 17 studies assessing QoL outcomes among cancer patients; 12 of which had negligible to small effect sizes, four reported medium effect sizes which were related to physical, global QoL, pain, and social (role) functioning and one reported a large effect size (fatigue). The most prevalent method for assessing response shift was the then-test, which is prone to recall bias, followed by the pre-test and post-test method. Given the heterogeneity among the characteristics of the samples and designs reviewed, as well as the overall small to negligible effect sizes for the effects reported, conclusions stating that changes due to internal cognitive shifts in perceived QoL should account for changes observed in cancer patients' QoL outcomes should be interpreted with caution.Conclusion: Further work is needed in this area of research. Future studies should control for patient characteristics, time elapsed between diagnosis and baseline assessment and evaluate their contribution to the presence of response shift. Time between assessments should include short and longer periods between assessments and evaluate whether the presence of response shift holds over time. Possible avenues for inquiry for future investigation are discussed.}

  abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

  abstract = {The current study sought to examine the discriminant validity of 3 commonly used measures of mindfulness. The discriminative ability of the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and a breath counting task (BCT) was assessed in a randomized control trial involving an 8-week mindfulness training (MT) condition (n = 53) and an active control computerized attention training (CT) program (n = 33). No evidence to support the discriminant validity of MAAS or FFMQ scores was found, as these self-report measures responded to both the MT and CT conditions. Breath counting scores however demonstrated unique responsiveness to the MT program, suggesting this behavioral task may be useful in measuring changes in mindfulness as it closely resembles core cognitive processes trained during this practice. Implications of these findings for the construct validity of both self-report and behavioral measures of mindfulness are discussed, along with the suitability of current mindfulness-based interventions in studies aiming to assess mindfulness outcomes.

This study included 508 patients with cancer treated in either inpatient or outpatient clinics of 5 oncology centers in Ankara, Turkey, between August 1998 and January 2000. Patients were selected by interviews. Data were collected by a questionnaire to determine disease features and to evaluate patients' quality of life. We found that several disease features, including treatment, early diagnosis, disease acceptance, pain, psychological distress, and caregivers, had an effect on patients' quality of life (P {$<$} 0.05), whereas loss of organ and duration of disease did not. The results of this study underline the significant effect of psychosocial care programs on quality of life. In the future, assessments of quality of life can help healthcare personnel to prepare psychosocial care programs. (C) 2001 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

Through this special issue on Green HRM, we seek to stimulate the field of HRM to expand its role in the pursuit of environmentally sustainable business. In this introduction to the special issue, we first provide an overview of the articles that appear in the special issue. Next we present a detailed discussion of research questions that arise from a consideration of several functional HRM practices, including performance management; training, development, and learning; compensation and rewards; and organizational culture. We conclude by describ- ing opportunities for research at the intersection of strategic HRM and environmental man- agement. If pursued with vigor, research addressing this extensive agenda could begin to estab- lish a healthy field of Green HRM scholarship},

  abstract = {Fluid intelligence (Gf) refers to the ability to reason and to solve new problems independently of previously acquired knowledge. Gf is critical for a wide variety of cognitive tasks, and it is considered one of the most important factors in learning. Moreover, Gf is closely related to professional and educational success, especially in complex and demanding environments. Although performance on tests of Gf can be improved through direct practice on the tests themselves, there is no evidence that training on any other regimen yields increased Gf in adults. Furthermore, there is a long history of research into cognitive training showing that, although performance on trained tasks can increase dramatically, transfer of this learning to other tasks remains poor. Here, we present evidence for transfer from training on a demanding working memory task to measures of Gf. This transfer results even though the trained task is entirely different from the intelligence test itself. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the extent of gain in intelligence critically depends on the amount of training: the more training, the more improvement in Gf. That is, the training effect is dosage-dependent. Thus, in contrast to many previous studies, we conclude that it is possible to improve Gf without practicing the testing tasks themselves, opening a wide range of applications.},

This study aims to investigate the extent to which ResearchGate members as authors of journal articles comply with publishers’ copyright policies when they self-archive full-text of their articles on ResearchGate. A random sample of 500 English journal articles available as full-text on ResearchGate were investigated. 108 articles (21.6\%) were open access (OA) published in OA journals or hybrid journals. Of the remaining 392 articles, 61 (15.6\%) were preprint, 24 (6.1\%) were post-print and 307 (78.3\%) were published (publisher) PDF. The key finding was that 201 (51.3\%) out of 392 non-OA articles infringed the copyright and were non-compliant with publishers’ policy. While 88.3\% of journals allowed some form of self-archiving (SHERPA/RoMEO green, blue or yellow journals), the majority of non-compliant cases (97.5\%) occurred when authors self-archived publishers’ PDF files (final published version). This indicates that authors infringe copyright most of the time not because they are not allowed to self-archive, but because they use the wrong version, which might imply their lack of understanding of copyright policies and/or complexity and diversity of policies.},

  abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients' satisfaction with cancer care has not been studied in detail in the South-Asian region in spite of rising cancer incidence. OBJECTIVE: To validate the 'Sinhala' translation of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) in-patient satisfaction with care questionnaire (IN-PATSAT32) in Sri Lanka. METHOD: We administered the translated version of the IN-PATSAT32 on 343 newly diagnosed adult in-patients with cancers of head and neck, breast, oesophagus, cervix uteri and lung, recruited from seven tertiary care oncology treatment centres in the District of Colombo. Patients with previous cancer diagnoses, too frail/mentally unfit, with evidence of brain metastases and unable/unwilling to give informed consent were excluded. Psychometric testing assessed the hypothesized scale structure, scale reliability, construct validity and acceptability of the IN-PATSAT32. RESULTS: A high response rate (100\%) and low missing data (0.05\%) confirmed the acceptability of the IN-PATSAT32. The hypothesized scale structure was confirmed with 100\% item-convergent and 98.6\% item-discriminant validity, and a scaling success rate, defined as items correlating significantly higher (more than 1.96 standard errors) with its own scale (corrected for overlap) than with another scale, of 97.9\%. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient for internal consistency exceeded 0.70 in all scales. Construct validity was confirmed with inter-scale correlations, which were all statistically significant (P{$<$}0.01) and were of moderate-to-high magnitude, evidence that they were measuring distinct dimensions of patient satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The translated version of the IN-PATSAT32 has proved to be a reliable and valid measure of satisfaction with cancer care in patients with heterogeneous cancer diagnoses in Sri Lanka.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional multi-practice study using the general practice assessment survey. SETTING: General practices in Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-six general practices and 7505 chronic illness patients aged {$>$}or=18 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Access of care and patient-centredness. RESULTS: Two factors were identified in factor analysis: 'Access of care' and 'Patient-centredness'. Multilevel regression analysis showed significant associations between patients' assessments and patient and practice characteristics. Patients from smaller practices (one to three general practitioners) reported better access to care compared with larger practices. Patients from urban areas were more satisfied with patient-centredness than those from rural areas. Self-reported health status and age had a positive and home ownership, employment and education, and patients from non-English-speaking countries a negative relationship with both scores. Females were more satisfied with patient-centredness. CONCLUSIONS: Patient assessments of quality of care and patient-centredness were strongly associated with practice and patient characteristics. This has important implications for interpreting assessments of the quality of primary care, and for policy and practice measures designed to improve this.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine what aspects of healthcare provision are most likely to influence satisfaction with care and willingness to recommend hospital services to others and, secondly, to explore the extent to which satisfaction is a meaningful indicator of patient experience of healthcare services. DESIGN: Postal survey of a sample of patients who underwent a period of inpatient care. Patients were asked to evaluate their overall experience of this episode of care and to complete the Picker Inpatient Survey questionnaire on specific aspects of their care. SAMPLE: Patients aged 18 and over presenting at five hospitals within one NHS trust in Scotland. METHOD: 3592 questionnaires were mailed to patients' homes within 1 month of discharge from hospital during a 12 month period. Two reminders were sent to non-responders; 2249 (65\%) questionnaires were returned. RESULTS: Almost 90\% of respondents indicated that they were satisfied with their period of inpatient care. Age and overall self-assessed health were only weakly associated with satisfaction. A multiple linear regression indicated that the major determinants of patient satisfaction were physical comfort, emotional support, and respect for patient preferences. However, many patients who reported their satisfaction with the care they received also indicated problems with their inpatient care as measured on the Picker Inpatient Survey; 55\% of respondents who rated their inpatient episode as "excellent" indicated problems on 10\% of the issues measured on the Picker questionnaire. DISCUSSION: The evidence suggests that patient satisfaction scores present a limited and optimistic picture. Detailed questions about specific aspects of patients' experiences are likely to be more useful for monitoring the performance of various hospital departments and wards and could point to ways in which delivery of health care could be improved.},

  abstract = {Improvements in attentional performance are at the core of proposed mechanisms for stress reduction in mindfulness meditation practices. However, this claim can be questioned because no previous studies have actively manipulated test effort in control groups and controlled for effects of stress reduction per se. In a blinded design, 48 young, healthy meditation novices were randomly assigned to a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), nonmindfulness stress reduction (NMSR), or inactive control group. At posttest, inactive controls were randomly split into nonincentive and incentive controls, the latter receiving a financial reward to improve attentional performance. Pre- and postintervention, 5 validated attention paradigms were employed along with self-report scales on mindfulness and perceived stress and saliva cortisol samples to measure physiological stress. Attentional effects of MBSR, NMSR, and the financial incentive were comparable or significantly larger in the incentive group on all reaction-time-based measures. However, selective attention in the MBSR group improved significantly more than in any other group. Similarly, only the MBSR intervention improved the threshold for conscious perception and visual working memory capacity. Furthermore, stress-reducing effects of MBSR were supported because those in the MBSR group showed significantly less perceived and physiological stress while increasing their mindfulness levels significantly. We argue that MBSR may contribute uniquely to attentional improvements but that further research focusing on non-reaction-time-based measures and outcomes less confounded by test effort is needed. Critically, our data demonstrate that previously observed improvements of attention after MBSR may be seriously confounded by test effort and nonmindfulness stress reduction.

  abstract = {Mindfulness is defined as paying attention in the present moment. We investigate the hypothesis that mindfulness training may alter or enhance specific aspects of attention. We examined three functionally and neuroanatomically distinct but overlapping attentional subsystems: alerting, orienting, and conflict monitoring. Functioning of each subsystem was indexed by performance on the Attention Network Test. Two types of mindfulness training (MT) programs were examined, and behavioral testing was conducted on participants before (Time 1) and after (Time 2) training. One training group consisted of individuals naive to mindfulness techniques who participated in an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) course that emphasized the development of concentrative meditation skills. The other training group consisted of individuals experienced in concentrative meditation techniques who participated in a 1-month intensive mindfulness retreat. Performance of these groups was compared with that of control participants who were meditation naive and received no MT. At Time 1, the participants in the retreat group demonstrated improved conflict monitoring performance relative to those in the MBSR and control groups. At Time 2, the participants in the MBSR course demonstrated significantly improved orienting in comparison with the control and retreat participants. In contrast, the participants in the retreat group demonstrated altered performance on the alerting component, with improvements in exogenous stimulus detection in comparison with the control and MBSR participants. The groups did not differ in conflict monitoring performance at Time 2. These results suggest that mindfulness training may improve attention-related behavioral responses by enhancing functioning of specific subcomponents of attention. Whereas participation in the MBSR course improved the ability to endogenously orient attention, retreat participation appeared to allow for the development and emergence of receptive attentional skills, which improved exogenous alerting-related process.},

Although some efforts have been made to formalize description of nursing practice in Japan with the International Classification of Nursing Practice (ICNP), lack of effective description tools has impacted negatively on the initiatives. PURPOSE To develop and evaluate an ontological approach that could be used to facilitate the description of nursing practice in Japan with the ICNP. METHODOLOGY An ontology-based support system was developed using Protégé-2000, mainly by the following three steps: (1) representing a standard classification of nursing practice (the Nursing Master) in Japan; (2) representing a Japanese version of the ICNP; (3) designing an ontology-based framework. A heuristic matching algorithm was developed to automatically match the action labels in the Nursing Master with the terms of the eight axes of the ICNP Nursing Actions Classification. A preliminary evaluation was performed to examine the usefulness of the system. RESULTS High hit rate was shown on the ICNP axes ActionType, Target, and Location. The evaluation indicated that 51.7+/-5.8\% (mean+/-S.D.) of the action labels with only one action type were properly matched, and that in 80+/-4\% (mean+/-S.D.) of action labels with more than one action type, at least one valid action type was matched correctly. CONCLUSION The ontology-based approach using a frame-based knowledge representation system (e.g., Protégé-2000) is useful for supporting the formal description of nursing practice in Japan with the ICNP.},

  abstract = {Emotional intelligence is an essential trait and skill for healthcare professionals. Mindfulness meditation has proved to be effective in increasing the wellbeing of those who practice it, leading to better mental health, self-care and job satisfaction. This paper aims to identify the recent evidence on the relationship between mindfulness and emotional intelligence among healthcare professionals and students. A systematic review was conducted including the databases PubMed, Cinhal, PsycINFO and Web of Science. The main variables were emotional intelligence skills and mindfulness practice. Data were extracted according to the following outcomes: authors, year of publication, country, study design, participants, mindfulness training intervention, tools used in data collection and main results. The following inclusion criteria were applied: peer-reviewed articles; published in English or Spanish; published between 2010 and 2020; quantitative methodology; a study population of healthcare professionals or students; the relationship with the aim of the study. The Joanna Briggs Institute criteria were followed for assessing the methodological quality of the selected studies. Three researchers were involved in the review. After the selection process, 10 studies were selected out of the 197 references initially identified. These studies revealed a positive relationship between mindfulness and emotional intelligence, particularly the capacity to regulate emotions. Furthermore, mindfulness is negatively related to emotional exhaustion. Training interventions based on mindfulness have proved to be useful in promoting emotional balance, emotional awareness, emotional acceptance, emotion recognition, expressive suppression and a reduction in emotional exhaustion. This study could serve as a basis for further research on the benefits of emotional intelligence and practicing mindfulness for the bio-psycho-social welfare of healthcare professionals.},

  abstract = {Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a relatively new learning method used for binary classification. The basic idea is to find a hyperplane which separates the d-dimensional data perfectly into its two classes. However, since example data is often not linearly separable, SVMs introduce the notion of a kernel induced feature space which casts the data into a higher dimensional space where the data is separable. Typically, casting into such a space would cause problems computationally, and with overfitting. The key insight used in SVMs is that the higher-dimensional space doesnt need to be dealt with directly (as it turns out, only the formula for the dot-product in that space is needed), which eliminates the above concerns. Furthermore, the VC-dimension (a measure of a systems likelihood to perform well on unseen data) of SVMs can be explicitly calculated, unlike other learning methods like neural networks, for which there is no measure. Overall, SVMs are intuitive, theoretically well- founded, and have shown to be practically successful. SVMs have also been extended to solve regression tasks (where the system is trained to output a numerical value, rather than yes/no classification).},

  abstract = {Traditional accounts of verbal short-term memory explain differences in performance for different types of verbal material by reference to inherent characteristics of the verbal items making up memory sequences. The role of previous experience with sequences of different types is ostensibly controlled for either by deliberate exclusion or by presenting multiple trials constructed from different random permutations. We cast doubt on this general approach in a detailed analysis of the basis for the robust finding that short-term memory for digit sequences is superior to that for other sequences of verbal material. Specifically, we show across four experiments that this advantage is not due to inherent characteristics of digits as verbal items, nor are individual digits within sequences better remembered than other types of individual verbal items. Rather, the advantage for digit sequences stems from the increased frequency, compared to other verbal material, with which digits appear in random sequences in natural language, and furthermore, relatively frequent digit sequences support better short-term serial recall than less frequent ones. We also provide corpus-based computational support for the argument that performance in a short-term memory setting is a function of basic associative learning processes operating on the linguistic experience of the rememberer. The experimental and computational results raise questions not only about the role played by measurement of digit span in cognition generally, but also about the way in which long-term memory processes impact on short-term memory functioning.},

  abstract = {Graphical methods are being increasingly used for exploratory data analysis. Some of the many graphical tools that are useful in this setting are scatterplot matrices, nonparametric smoothers, and tree diagrams. Statistical graphics for presenting information have been used much longer, but most of the commonly used graphics used in papers, presentations, and the popular media, such as bar charts and pie charts, are either poor or misleading in communicating information to the reader. This tutorial begins with a series of graphical horror stories from the scientific and lay press. Then elements of graphical perception and good graph construction, many from the writings of Bill Cleveland, are covered. Practical suggestions for choosing the best chart or graph type, making good and clear graphics, and formatting are covered. Techniques for simultaneous presentation of multiple variables are described. Examples of model presentation graphics will also be given. The second part of the tutorial consists of interactive demonstrations of how to make effective statistical graphics using the freely available R environment for data analysis and graphics (www.R-project.org). This will focus on base, lattice and ggplot2 graphics as well as graphics functions in the presenter's Hmisc package. At the close of the workshop some graphical marvels from the literature (especially from Edward Tufte and Howard Wainer) are presented.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study tests the hypothesis that stress reduction methods based on mindfulness meditation can positively influence the rate at which psoriasis clears in patients undergoing phototherapy or photochemotherapy treatment. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with psoriasis about to undergo ultraviolet phototherapy (UVB) or photochemotherapy (PUVA) were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: a mindfulness meditation-based stress reduction intervention guided by audiotaped instructions during light treatments, or a control condition consisting of the light treatments alone with no taped instructions. Psoriasis status was assessed in three ways: direct inspection by unblinded clinic nurses; direct inspection by physicians blinded to the patient's study condition (tape or no-tape); and blinded physician evaluation of photographs of psoriasis lesions. Four sequential indicators of skin status were monitored during the study: a First Response Point, a Turning Point, a Halfway Point, and a Clearing Point. RESULTS: Cox-proportional hazards regression analysis showed that subjects in the tape groups reached the Halfway Point (p = .013) and the Clearing Point (p = .033) significantly more rapidly than those in the no-tape condition, for both UVB and PUVA treatments. CONCLUSIONS: A brief mindfulness meditation-based stress reduction intervention delivered by audiotape during ultraviolet light therapy can increase the rate of resolution of psoriatic lesions in patients with psoriasis.},

  abstract = {Sex differences in children's toy play are robust and similar across cultures [1,2]. They include girls tending to play more with dolls and boys more with wheeled toys and pretend weaponry. This pattern is explained by socialization by elders and peers, male rejection of opposite-sex behavior and innate sex differences in activity preferences that are facilitated by specific toys [1]. Evidence for biological factors is controversial but mounting. For instance, girls who have been exposed to high fetal androgen levels are known to make relatively masculine toy choices [3]. Also, when presented with sex-stereotyped human toys, captive female monkeys play more with typically feminine toys, whereas male monkeys play more with masculine toys [1]. In human and nonhuman primates, juvenile females demonstrate a greater interest in infants, and males in rough-and-tumble play. This sex difference in activity preferences parallels adult behavior and may contribute to differences in toy play [1]. Here, we present the first evidence of sex differences in use of play objects in a wild primate, in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We find that juveniles tend to carry sticks in a manner suggestive of rudimentary doll play and, as in children and captive monkeys, this behavior is more common in females than in males. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The psychophysics of value induce risk aversion in the domain of gains and risk seeking in the domain of losses. The psychophysics of chance induce overweighting of sure things and of improbable events, relative to events of moderate probability. Decision problems can be described or framed in multiple ways that give rise to different preferences, contrary to the invariance criterion of rational choice. The process of mental accounting, in which people organize the outcomes of transactions, explains some anomalies of consumer behavior. In particular, the acceptability of an option can depend on whether a negative outcome is evaluated as a cost or as an uncompensated loss. The relationships between decision values and experience values and between hedonic experience and objective states are discussed.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To summarize the development and application of a generic measure of health-related quality of life known as the Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB). BACKGROUND: The QWB is part of a general health policy model. The measure includes functional components for mobility, physical activity, and social activity. In addition, it includes a comprehensive list of symptoms and problems. QWB scoring allows placement of each individual on a continuum of wellness ranging from 0 (for dead) to 1.0 for asymptomatic full function. The General Health Policy Model combines this point in time measure with information on prognosis and mortality to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Forming a ratio of program costs to QALYs yields estimates of cost per quality-adjusted life year. Evidence supports the validity of the QWB for a wide variety of applications in population monitoring, descriptive studies of patient populations, and clinical trials. We offer a variety of comparisons between the QWB and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36). MAIN FINDINGS: In comparison with the SF-36, the QWB provides less information on health profiles, but has the advantage of providing a metric that can be used for cost-utility or cost-effectiveness analysis. Although ceiling effects are common for some SF-36 subscales, perfect scores on the QWB are very rare. The QWB has an approximately normal distribution for populations of adults. Although, often criticized for not including a mental health component, we present evidence documenting the validity of the QWB for patients with psychological and psychiatric diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: The QWB and SF-36 are alternative comprehensive measures of health outcomes.},

  abstract = {The Sexual Experiences Survey (Koss, Gidycz, \& Wisniewski, 1987) is a commonly used instrument for assessing various degrees of sexual aggression and victimization among male offenders and female victims. Rasch analysis was used to transform qualitative raw score observations into objective linear measures using the responses of a national sample of 6,159 higher education men and women across the United States, aged 18-24. This paper supports the construct validity of the survey through evaluation of the item hierarchy, fit statistics, and separation indices. Findings confirm a "dimensional" perspective on rape, suggesting that sexually aggressive behaviors can be scaled along a single continuum from normal to extreme sexual behavior. The item hierarchy reveals an arrangement of sexually aggressive acts in an order of mild to severe, which compares with the one theorized by the authors of the SES. Identity plots demonstrate the validity of using a common set of SES item calibrations to measure both male and female respondents. For interpretation of person responses to the SES, three conclusions are suggested. First, Rasch analysis must be employed to examine item responses effectively. Second, when the survey is administered to a college sample aged 18-24, the item calibrations obtained in this paper can be used to measure offenders and victims. Third, a total raw score-to-measure conversion is not always sufficient to interpret person measures. Instead, a scalogram method needs be added to the Rasch analysis to separate the measures of offenders and victims who complete the survey. Implications for future research are discussed.},

For testing, the proposed framework not require a deterministic axiom to be cast in a probabilistic (e.g., casting deterministic transitivity as weak stochastic). The generality of this framework is demonstrated through tests of 16 different axioms, including transitivity, monotonicity, segregation, additivity of joint receipt, dominance, coalescing, restricted branch independence, double, triple cancellation, and the Thomsen condition. The model many previously proposed methods of axiom testing under error, is analytically tractable, and provides a Bayesian for the random relation approach to probabilistic measurement(J. Math. Psychol. 40 (1996) 219). A hierarchical and nonparametric of the model is discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All reserved.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Contractures are a common complication of neurological and musculoskeletal conditions, and are characterised by a reduction in joint mobility. Stretch is widely used for the treatment and prevention of contractures. However, it is not clear whether stretch is effective. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of stretch on contractures in people with, or at risk of, contractures. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic searches were conducted on CENTRAL, DARE, HTA (The Cochrane Library); MEDLINE; CINAHL; EMBASE; SCI-EXPANDED; and PEDro (April 2009). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials of stretch applied for the purpose of treating or preventing contractures were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcomes of interest were joint mobility and quality of life. The secondary outcomes were pain, spasticity, activity limitation and participation restriction. Outcomes were evaluated immediately after intervention, in the short term (one to seven days) and in the long term ({$>$} one week). Effects were expressed as mean differences or standardised mean differences with 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Meta-analyses were conducted with a random-effects model. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-five studies with 1391 participants met the inclusion criteria. No study performed stretch for more than seven months. In people with neurological conditions, there was moderate to high quality evidence to indicate that stretch does not have clinically important immediate (mean difference 3 degrees ; 95\% CI 0 to 7), short-term (mean difference 1 degrees ; 95\% CI 0 to 3) or long-term (mean difference 0 degrees ; 95\% CI -2 to 2) effects on joint mobility. The results were similar for people with non-neurological conditions. For all conditions, there is little or no effect of stretch on pain, spasticity, activity limitation, participation restriction or quality of life. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Stretch does not have clinically important effects on joint mobility in people with, or at risk of, contractures if performed for less than seven months. The effects of stretch performed for periods longer than seven months have not been investigated.},

The sample consisted of 259 female (74\%) and 91 male (26\%) individuals aged between 18 and 51 (Mean = 24.23). Measures taken were demographics, the Ten-Item Personality Inventory, the Artificial Intelligence Anxiety Scale, and the General Attitudes toward Artificial Intelligence Scale. The Turkish GAAIS had good validity and reliability. Hierarchical Multiple Linear Regression Analyses showed that positive attitudes toward artificial intelligence were significantly predicted by the level of computer use (β = 0.139, p = 0.013), level of knowledge about artificial intelligence (β = 0.119, p = 0.029), and AI learning anxiety (β = −0.172, p = 0.004). Negative attitudes toward artificial intelligence were significantly predicted by agreeableness (β = 0.120, p = 0.019), AI configuration anxiety (β = −0.379, p {$<$} 0.001), and AI learning anxiety (β = −0.211, p {$<$} 0.001). Personality traits, AI anxiety, and demographics play important roles in attitudes toward AI. Results are discussed in light of the previous research and theoretical explanations.}

Test of performance strategies: Development and preliminary validation of a comprehensive measure of athletes' psychological skills. Journal of Sports Sciences, 17, 697-711].Results Four distinctive mindfulness clusters were found based on their response on the MMS using cluster analysis. Marked differences in flow dispositions and mental skills adoption habits were observed between the high and the low mindfulness clusters. Those in the high mindfulness cluster scored significantly higher than the low mindfulness clusters in challenge-skill balance, merging of action and awareness, clear goals, concentration and loss of self-consciousness scores of the DFS-2 [Jackson, S.A., \& Eklund, R.C. (2004). The flow scale manual. Morgantown, WV: Fitness Information Technology]. The high mindfulness clusters also scored significantly higher compared to the low mindfulness cluster in terms of attentional control, emotional control, goal setting and self-talk sub-scales of the TOPS.Conclusions This study suggests that athletes' flow dispositions and mental skills adoption could be differentiated using mindfulness. The findings have implications towards the understanding of flow and mental skills adoption within sport psychology.},

The advantage of visual data exploration is that the user is directly involved in the data mining process. There is a large number of information visualization techniques which have been developed over the last decade to support the exploration of large data sets. In this paper, we propose a classification of information visu- alization and visual data mining techniques which is based on the data type to be visualized, the visualization technique and the interaction and distortion technique. We exemplify the clas- sification using a few examples, most of them referring to techniques and systems presented in this special issue},

However, this advancement does not necessarily alleviate many common pitfalls in visualization for scientific journals, which can inhibit the ability of readers to effectively understand the information presented. To address this issue within the context of visualizing environmental data, we list ten guidelines for effective data visualization in scientific publications. These guidelines support the primary objective of data visualization, i.e. to effectively convey information. We believe that this small set of guidelines based on a review of key visualization literature can help researchers improve the communication of their results using effective visualization. Enhancement of environmental data visualization will further improve research presentation and communication within and across disciplines. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Most people are born creative. But over time, a lot of us learn to stifle those impulses. We become warier of judgment, more cautious, more analytical. The world seems to divide into "creatives" and "noncreatives," and too many people resign themselves to the latter category. And yet we know that creativity is essential to success in any discipline or industry. The good news, according to authors Tom Kelley and David Kelley of IDEO, is that we all can rediscover our creative confidence. The trick is to overcome the four big fears that hold most of us back: fear of the messy unknown, fear of judgment, fear of the first step, and fear of losing control. The authors use an approach based on the work of psychologist Albert Bandura in helping patients get over their snake phobias: You break challenges down into small steps and then build confidence by succeeding on one after another. Creativity is something you practice, say the authors, not just a talent you are born with. INSET: Tackling the Mess, One Step at a Time. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {Within the past few decades, there has been a surge of interest in the investigation of mindfulness as a psychological construct and as a form of clinical intervention. This article reviews the empirical literature on the effects of mindfulness on psychological health. We begin with a discussion of the construct of mindfulness, differences between Buddhist and Western psychological conceptualizations of mindfulness, and how mindfulness has been integrated into Western medicine and psychology, before reviewing three areas of empirical research: cross-sectional, correlational research on the associations between mindfulness and various indicators of psychological health; intervention research on the effects of mindfulness-oriented interventions on psychological health; and laboratory-based, experimental research on the immediate effects of mindfulness inductions on emotional and behavioral functioning. We conclude that mindfulness brings about various positive psychological effects, including increased subjective well-being, reduced psychological symptoms and emotional reactivity, and improved behavioral regulation. The review ends with a discussion on mechanisms of change of mindfulness interventions and suggested directions for future research.},

To address this omission, this paper introduces the simple difference formula. The formula states that the correlation equals the simple difference between the proportion of favorable and unfavorable evidence; in symbols this is r = f - u. For the Mann-Whitney U, the evidence consists of pairs. For the signed-rank test, the evidence consists of rank sums. Also, the formula applies to the Binomial Effect Size Display. The formula r = f - u means that a correlation r can yield a prediction so that the proportion correct is f and the proportion incorrect is u.}

The range of available test information, especially concerning test reviews, is considered as neither quantitatively nor qualitatively convincing and as staying behind the standards reached in other countries. Shows different approaches on the basis of selected international examples for test review systems (COTAN (Committee on Test Affairs Netherlands); EFPA (European Federation of Psychologists' Associations)) and discusses their pros and cons. Finally a new, three-step test information and review system is presented, taking the German standard DIN 33430 into consideration. Furthermore the implementation of the necessary institutionalization of the system application and control is outlined.},

  abstract = {Traditional null hypothesis significance testing does not yield the probability of the null or its alternative and, therefore, cannot logically ground scientific decisions. The decision theory proposed here calculates the expected utility of an effect on the basis of (1) the probability of replicating it and (2) a utility function on its size. It takes significance tests--which place all value on the replicability of an effect and none on its magnitude--as a special case, one in which the cost of a false positive is revealed to be an order of magnitude greater than the value of a true positive. More realistic utility functions credit both replicability and effect size, integrating them for a single index of merit. The analysis incorporates opportunity cost and is consistent with alternate measures of effect size, such as r2 and information transmission, and with Bayesian model selection criteria. An alternate formulation is functionally equivalent to the formal theory, transparent, and easy to compute.},

The semantics represented by the ICNP were completely related to the RIM implying that the ICNP is a good candidate terminology to encode the data with in an electronic documentation system. A few differences between the two models in representing the same semantics suggests that there is value to supporting broad ranges of semantic relations in the ICNP.},

This literature review gathers the thinking of scholars on the importance of mindfulness and its beneficial practices—particularly in Western contexts—including mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and related therapies. The literature review is also a motivator in the use of mindfulness because it reveals its proven role in both helping career professionals and reducing stress for students by reducing the psychological and physical distress inherent in work and personal lives or students’ academic lives.},

Die Studie ergab, dass Expertise einen signifikant positiven Einfluss auf die Glaubwürdigkeit hat. Experten wurden demnach durchgängig für glaubwürdiger gehalten als Nicht-Experten. Die Faktoren Prominenz und Attraktivität hatten jeweils einen signifikant negativen Effekt, d.h. je prominenter und je attraktiver eine Person dargestellt wurde, umso weniger wurde ihr geglaubt. Das Geschlecht hatte keine signifikanten Einfluss. Die Studie zeigt damit, dass die Glaubwürdigkeit einer Person am effektivsten über das Darlegen der fachlichen Eignung gesteigert werden kann und nicht über die physische Attraktivität oder Prominenz, die vor allem in ihrer Kombination in der öffentlichkeit oftmals als Ideal dargestellt werden.

Die Studie ergab, dass Expertise einen signifikant positiven Einfluss auf die Glaubwürdigkeit hat. Experten wurden demnach durchgängig für glaubwürdiger gehalten als Nicht-Experten. Die Faktoren Prominenz und Attraktivität hatten jeweils einen signifikant negativen Effekt, d.h. je prominenter und je attraktiver eine Person dargestellt wurde, umso weniger wurde ihr geglaubt. Das Geschlecht hatte keine signifikanten Einfluss. Die Studie zeigt damit, dass die Glaubwürdigkeit einer Person am effektivsten über das Darlegen der fachlichen Eignung gesteigert werden kann und nicht über die physische Attraktivität oder Prominenz, die vor allem in ihrer Kombination in der öffentlichkeit oftmals als Ideal dargestellt werden.

  abstract = {Working memory (WM) capacity predicts performance in a wide range of cognitive tasks. Although WM capacity has been viewed as a constant trait, recent studies suggest that it can be improved by adaptive and extended training. This training is associated with changes in brain activity in frontal and parietal cortex and basal ganglia, as well as changes in dopamine receptor density. Transfer of the training effects to non-trained WM tasks is consistent with the notion of training-induced plasticity in a common neural network for WM. The observed training effects suggest that WM training could be used as a remediating intervention for individuals for whom low WM capacity is a limiting factor for academic performance or in everyday life. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Spirituality is increasingly being examined as a construct related to mental and physical health. The definition of spirituality, however, has been changing. Traditionally, spirituality was used to describe the deeply religious person, but it has now expanded to include the superficially religious person, the religious seeker, the seeker of well-being and happiness, and the completely secular person. Instruments used to measure spirituality reflect this trend. These measures are heavily contaminated with questions assessing positive character traits or mental health: optimism, forgiveness, gratitude, meaning and purpose in life, peacefulness, harmony, and general well-being. Spirituality, measured by indicators of good mental health, is found to be correlated with good mental health. This research has been reported in some of the world's top medical journals. Such associations are meaningless and tautological. Either spirituality should be defined and measured in traditional terms as a unique, uncontaminated construct, or it should be eliminated from use in academic research.

Furthermore the mappings, quality of match, and experiences of mapping was evaluated to discuss the domain completeness and utility of the ICNP in depicting the typical situation of oncological patients. The finding of this study will be submitted to the ICNP Review Process. The results can contribute to extending the ICNP content.

A cross-temporal meta-analysis was conducted on 72 samples of American college students who completed at least one of the four subscales (Empathic Concern, Perspective Taking, Fantasy, and Personal Distress) of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) between 1979 and 2009 (total N = 13,737). Overall, the authors found changes in the most prototypically empathic subscales of the IRI: Empathic Concern was most sharply dropping, followed by Perspective Taking. The IRI Fantasy and Personal Distress subscales exhibited no changes over time. Additional analyses found that the declines in Perspective Taking and Empathic Concern are relatively recent phenomena and are most pronounced in samples from after 2000.},

  abstract = {Trust pervades human societies. Trust is indispensable in friendship, love, families and organizations, and plays a key role in economic exchange and politics. In the absence of trust among trading partners, market transactions break down. In the absence of trust in a country's institutions and leaders, political legitimacy breaks down. Much recent evidence indicates that trust contributes to economic, political and social success. Little is known, however, about the biological basis of trust among humans. Here we show that intranasal administration of oxytocin, a neuropeptide that plays a key role in social attachment and affiliation in non-human mammals, causes a substantial increase in trust among humans, thereby greatly increasing the benefits from social interactions. We also show that the effect of oxytocin on trust is not due to a general increase in the readiness to bear risks. On the contrary, oxytocin specifically affects an individual's willingness to accept social risks arising through interpersonal interactions. These results concur with animal research suggesting an essential role for oxytocin as a biological basis of prosocial approach behaviour.},

The analysis presented is based on a dataset of over 58,000 volunteers who provided their Facebook Likes, detailed demographic profiles, and the results of several psychometric tests. The proposed model uses dimensionality reduction for preprocessing the Likes data, which are then entered into logistic/linear regression to predict individual psychodemographic profiles from Likes. The model correctly discriminates between homosexual and heterosexual men in 88\% of cases, African Americans and Caucasian Americans in 95\% of cases, and between Democrat and Republican in 85\% of cases. For the personality trait “Openness,” prediction accuracy is close to the test--retest accuracy of a standard personality test. We give examples of associations between attributes and Likes and discuss implications for online personalization and privacy.},

It constitutes a large and diverse pool of participants, who can be selectively recruited for both online and offline studies. Additionally, it facilitates data collection by storing detailed records of its users’ demographic profiles, social interactions, and behaviors. With participants’ consent, these data can be recorded retrospectively in a convenient, accurate, and inexpensive way. Based on our experience in designing, implementing, and maintaining multiple Facebook-based psychological studies that attracted over 10 million participants, we demonstrate how to recruit participants using Facebook, incentivize them effectively, and maximize their engagement. We also outline the most important opportunities and challenges associated with using Facebook for research, provide several practical guidelines on how to successfully implement studies on Facebook, and finally, discuss ethical considerations.

Another approach was to consider other categories from measures or instruments already linked in the literature. Results.{$\quad$}ICF Categories have been pooled from six core sets for MSK conditions, two specific care settings, one MSK clinical trial setting and eight instrument linkage papers. Conclusions.{$\quad$}The ICD--ICF joint use would be able to capture the impact of a health condition by taking into account the disease and functioning status which would facilitate clinical care. Therefore, there is reasonable ground to demonstrate the operational linkage and complementary role of the ICD and the ICF in the context of the ICD revision.}

  abstract = {Psychometric scales are useful tools in understanding people’s attitudes towards different aspects of life. As societies develop and new technologies arise, new validated scales are needed. Robots and artificial intelligences of various kinds are about to occupy just about every niche in human society. Several tools to measure fears and anxieties about robots do exist, but there is a definite lack of tools to measure hopes and expectations for these new technologies. Here, we create and validate a novel multi-dimensional scale which measures people’s attitudes towards robots, giving equal weight to positive and negative attitudes. Our scale differentiates (a) comfort and enjoyment around robots, (b) unease and anxiety around robots, (c) rational hopes about robots in general (at societal level) and (d) rational worries about robots in general (at societal level). The scale was developed by extracting items from previous scales, crowdsourcing new items, testing through 3 scale iterations by exploratory factor analysis (Ns 135, 801 and 609) and validated in its final form of the scale by confirmatory factor analysis (N: 477). We hope our scale will be a useful instrument for social scientists who wish to study human-technology relations with a validated scale in efficient and generalizable ways.},

  abstract = {Ninety-nine knees in 81 patients evaluated from two to ten years and having enough valgus deformity to require specific soft-tissue release were studied. They were also compared to a control group of 40 knees in 31 patients with no angular deformity greater than 5 degrees, who were matched for age and diagnosis. All procedures were performed using a minimally constrained, posterior-cruciate-ligament-sparing prosthesis. Pre- and postoperative axial alignment was measured on weight-bearing long-standing roentgenographs. Analysis included examination for lucent lines in postoperative fluoroscopically positioned roentgenographs and clinical data summarized using the 100-point scoring systems developed by The Knee Society. Knees were classified as having Type I, II, or III valgus deformities: Type I was defined as valgus deformity secondary to bone loss in the lateral compartment and soft-tissue contracture with medial soft tissues intact; Type II was defined as obvious attenuation of the medial capsular ligament complex; and Type III was defined as severe valgus deformity with valgus malpositioning of the proximal tibial joint line after overcorrected proximal tibial osteotomy. Only cases of Type I and Type II were represented in the 99 knees reported. Type I patients were treated with lateral soft-tissue release, and Type II patients were treated with medial capsular ligament tightening (i.e., ligament reconstruction procedures on the medial side). The Knee Society postoperative knee score was 87.6 (+/- 10.6) and mean postoperative functional score was 52.3. Alignment was well corrected and knee scores for the Type I and II groups were almost identical as were the functional scores. The results were grouped as 72\% excellent, 18\% good, 7\% fair, and 2\% poor. Notably, the control group was 39 of 40 patients excellent, and only one poor. Ligament stability was satisfactorily established by lateral release in Type I and with the combined medial plication in the Type II patients. The ligament-tightening procedures were on the average 40 minutes longer than those for the Type I or the control groups. The controversial nature of the simultaneous ligament reconstruction method is recognized, but good experience is reported.},

Programs to reduce burnout before it results in impairment are rare; data on these programs are scarce.Objective To determine whether an intensive educational program in mindfulness, communication, and self-awareness is associated with improvement in primary care physicians' well-being, psychological distress, burnout, and capacity for relating to patients.Design, Setting, and Participants Before-and-after study of 70 primary care physicians in Rochester, New York, in a continuing medical education (CME) course in 2007-2008. The course included mindfulness meditation, self-awareness exercises, narratives about meaningful clinical experiences, appreciative interviews, didactic material, and discussion. An 8-week intensive phase (2.5 h/wk, 7-hour retreat) was followed by a 10-month maintenance phase (2.5 h/mo).Main Outcome Measures Mindfulness (2 subscales), burnout (3 subscales), empathy (3 subscales), psychosocial orientation, personality (5 factors), and mood (6 subscales) measured at baseline and at 2, 12, and 15 months.Results Over the course of the program and follow-up, participants demonstrated improvements in mindfulness (raw score, 45.2 to 54.1; raw score change [Δ], 8.9; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 7.0 to 10.8); burnout (emotional exhaustion, 26.8 to 20.0; Δ = −6.8; 95\% CI, −4.8 to −8.8; depersonalization, 8.4 to 5.9; Δ = −2.5; 95\% CI, −1.4 to −3.6; and personal accomplishment, 40.2 to 42.6; Δ = 2.4; 95\% CI, 1.2 to 3.6); empathy (116.6 to 121.2; Δ = 4.6; 95\% CI, 2.2 to 7.0); physician belief scale (76.7 to 72.6; Δ = −4.1; 95\% CI, −1.8 to −6.4); total mood disturbance (33.2 to 16.1; Δ = −17.1; 95\% CI, −11 to −23.2), and personality (conscientiousness, 6.5 to 6.8; Δ = 0.3; 95\% CI, 0.1 to 5 and emotional stability, 6.1 to 6.6; Δ = 0.5; 95\% CI, 0.3 to 0.7). Improvements in mindfulness were correlated with improvements in total mood disturbance (r = −0.39, P {$<$} .001), perspective taking subscale of physician empathy (r = 0.31, P {$<$} .001), burnout (emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment subscales, r = −0.32 and 0.33, respectively; P {$<$} .001), and personality factors (conscientiousness and emotional stability, r = 0.29 and 0.25, respectively; P {$<$} .001).Conclusions Participation in a mindful communication program was associated with short-term and sustained improvements in well-being and attitudes associated with patient-centered care. Because before-and-after designs limit inferences about intervention effects, these findings warrant randomized trials involving a variety of practicing physicians.}

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ninety-nine patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), including 68 with LN, were examined. Gene polymorphisms were analyzed using standard molecular genetic techniques. The frequency of the clinical manifestations of LN was analyzed; renal survival (RS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Ten-year RS rates were 80 and 86\% of the patients with and without the mutant IL-10 allele, respectively (p = 0.78). The 10-year RS was lower (75\%) in carriers of the mutant IL-28 rsl2979860 allele than in patients without this mutant allele (83\%; p = 0.049) and in those of the mutant IL28 rs8099917 allele than in patients without the above mutant allele (67 and 88\%, respectively; p = 0.047). LN patients, carriers of the mutant IL-10-1028 G/A allele, were observed to have higher-grade proteinuria in the presence of nephritic syndrome (mean 6.1 g/l) than those without the mutant allele of this gene (mean 2.9 g/l; p = 0.034). However, the mutant allele carriers responded to treatment better (p = 0.050). The mutant IL-10 and IL-28 alleles were unassociated with the development of rapidly progressive nephritis, the activity of a renal lupus process, and the rate of onset of SLE and LN. CONCLUSION: In the LN patients, the carriage of the mutant IL-10 allele A is associated with a better response to treatment and that of the mutant IL-28 allele is linked to the severe course of the disease.},

PARTICIPANTS: 100 women. Design and interventions: Patients were randomly allocated to outpatient hysteroscopy or day case hysteroscopy provided they had no preference for either procedure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Satisfaction rate, requirements for postoperative analgesia, speed of recovery, time away from home, and time off work. RESULTS: The outpatient group recovered preoperative fitness more quickly than the day case group (2 days (range 1-2.7) versus 3 days (2-4), P{$<$}0.05). After the procedure, the outpatient group were also fully mobile more quickly than the day case group (0 minutes (0-5) versus 105 minutes (80-120), P{$<$}0.001). Requirements for postoperative analgesia were similar in both groups. Overall, 78\% of patients considered that the pain from outpatient hysteroscopy was less than that usually experienced during menstruation. Patient satisfaction was similar in both groups (83.6\% in the outpatient group versus 77.0\% in the day case group). CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient hysteroscopy and day case hysteroscopy were equally acceptable to patients.

(Kosko (1992)) Artificial neural networks have developed from generalized neural biological principles. McCulloch and Pitts (1943) proposed the neuron as a binary threshing device in discrete time. (Ripley (1996)) Neurons are now known to be more complicated than this model having a graded, rather than threshold, response, operating in continuous time, and achieving nonlinear functions of inputs. (Ripley (1996)) Compared to computers, however, neurons are rather slow, with a speed of about 100 meters/second. (Ripley (1996)) To compensate for this lack of speed, the human brain is highly distributed and massively parallel. (Ripley (1996)) As parallel processes go the human brain is unsurpassed. The pattern of connections between neurons proves to be an ideal model for the neural network’s architecture (Fausett (1994)) Neural networks are essentially comprising three pieces: the architecture or model; the learning algorithm; and the activation functions. (Fausett (1994)) Neural networks are programed or “trained ” to “... store, recognize, and associatively retrieve patterns or database entries; to solve combinatorial optimization problems; to filter noise from measurement data; to control ill-defined problems; in summary, to estimate sampled functions when we do not know the form of the functions. ” (Kosko (1992), p.13) It is precisely these two abilities (pattern recognition and function}

Participants (N = 112) were divided into four groups (n = 28). They either exclusively studied 36 action phrases (e.g., "lift the glass") or both studied and cued-recalled them in four trials. During study trials participants encoded the action phrases either by motorically performing them, or by reading them aloud, and they took final verb-cued recall tests over 18-min and 1-week retention intervals. A testing effect was demonstrated for action phrases, however, only when they were verbally encoded, and not when they were enacted. Similarly, enactive (relative to verbal) encoding reduced the rate of forgetting, but only when the action phrases were exclusively studied, and not when they were also tested. These less-than-additive effects of enactment and testing on the rate of forgetting, as well as on long-term retention, support the notion that both study techniques effectively promote item-specific processing that can only be marginally increased further by combining them.},

  abstract = {Seit Mitte der neunziger Jahre gewinnen Delphi-Befragungen wachsende Bedeutung in Politik und Wirtschaft. Denn sie ermöglichen es, stichhaltige Einschätzungen über einen per se unklaren Sachverhalt - zum Beispiel die Zukunft des Internet - zu generieren. Dazu werden Experten in einem mehrstufigen, anonymen Verfahren nach ihrer Einschätzung gefragt und dadurch zu kompetenteren Urteilen geleitet. Dieses Buch ist Einführung in und Arbeitsbuch für die Durchführung von Delphi-Befragungen. Der Autor gibt Anleitungen für das adäquate Design der vier etablierten Befragungstypen (Aggregation von Ideen, Strukturierung eines diffusen Sachverhalts, Qualifizierung von Expertenmeinungen, Schaffung eines Konsenses unter den Experten). Dabei stellt er jeweils alle wichtigen Aspekte des Verfahrens detailliert dar, zum Beispiel die Auswahl der Teilnehmer, die Erstellung des Fragebogens, die Gestaltung des Feed-backs und die Analyse der gewonnenen Daten. Darüber hinaus soll der Band die von Kritikern oft eingeforderte theoretische Fundierung des Verfahrens liefern. Basis dazu sind kognitionspsychologische Überlegungen und empirische Befunde zur Evaluation des Delphi-Ansatzes. Zahlreiche kommentierte Literaturhinweise ermöglichen dem interessierten Leser gezielten Zugang zu weiteren Informationen.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Meditation is a self-regulatory psychological strategy that is frequently applied in Western as well as non-Western countries for different purposes; little is known about adverse events. SAMPLING AND METHODS: A male patient is described who developed an acute and transient psychosis with polymorphic symptomatology after meditating. A literature search for psychotic states related to meditation was carried out on PubMed, Embase and PsycInfo. RESULTS: In the case presented a diagnosis of acute polymorphic psychotic disorder was made. Other case reports dealt with either a relapse of a pre-existent psychotic disorder or with a brief psychotic reaction in patients without a psychiatric history. CONCLUSION: Meditation can act as a stressor in vulnerable patients who may develop a transient psychosis with polymorphic symptomatology. The syndrome is not culture bound but sometimes classified in culture-bound taxonomies like Qi-gong Psychotic Reaction.},

  abstract = {The present investigation examined the influence of litigant physical attractiveness on the decisions of 91 undergraduates playing the role of non-deliberating jurors in an automobile negligence trial. Seeking to achieve a more realistic simulation of actual courtroom practice than that produced in prior studies, which have relied exclusively on short written synopses as their method of trial presentation, this experiment tested the hypothesis that physical attractiveness would have a significant impact on juridic judgments even though the audiovisual presentation of the trial permitted the introduction of a variety of the important stimuli typically present at a jury trial. This prediction received empirical support: Subjects exposed to an attractive plaintiff and an unattractive defendant more often found in favor of the plaintiff and awarded more money in damages than students viewing an unattractive plaintiff and an attractive defendant. However in contrast to findings from general studies of interpersonal evaluation, analyses of student perceptions of the two litigants provided only limited evidence for a global (positive) physical attractiveness stereotype within the context of a simulated trial. Instead, the observed effect of physical attractiveness on student decisions was apparently mediated by differential perceptions of the seriousness of the accident itself. Possible implications of the results for the judicial process were mentioned.}

  abstract = {Abstract                            Objectives               Despite various methodological concerns, previous studies mainly use questionnaires to assess mindfulness. Following a multi-measurement approach, the present study aimed to evaluate the added value of an experience-sampling measure in the context of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression.                                         Method                                Data were collected in a PTSD group, depression group, and control group (each                 n                 = 33). The Mindful-Breathing Exercise (MBE) was used as an experience-sampling method and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) as a mindfulness questionnaire. Clinical variables included PTSD and depressive symptoms.                                                        Results                                Scores from the MBE and the FFMQ were positively correlated in the control group (                 r                 = 0.48) and the depression group (                 r                 = 0.28), while a non-significant correlation emerged for the PTSD group. On the level of FFMQ facets, results were heterogeneous among the three groups. The MBE predicted hyperarousal (                 β                 = − 0.41) and intrusions (                 β                 = − 0.32) in the PTSD group, whereas the FFMQ predicted depressive symptoms in the depression group (                 β                 = − 0.41) and the control group (                 β                 = − 0.65). Compared to the control group, the PTSD group (                 d                 = 1.88) and the depression group (                 d                 = 1.67) demonstrated lower FFMQ scores. In terms of the MBE, there was a trend towards higher scores in the control group than either clinical group.                                                        Conclusions               Findings hint at conceptual overlaps and distinctive features of both measurement approaches. With respect to the clinical context, results suggest an added value of the MBE to questionnaire-based assessments of mindfulness with respect to its predictive value for hyperarousal and intrusions.

The motivation to be accurate enhances use of those beliefs and strategies that are considered most appropriate, whereas the motivation to arrive at particular conclusions enhances use of those that are considered most likely to yield the desired conclusion. There is considerable evidence that people are more likely to arrive at conclusions that they want to arrive at, but their ability to do so is constrained by their ability to construct seemingly reasonable justifications for these conclusions. These ideas can account for a wide variety of research concerned with motivated reasoning.},

The purpose of this study was to validate the applicability of ICNP for electronic nursing records in a gynecological setting. A Chinese version of the ICNP beta 2 browser was used to code nursing record sentences. Medical charts were reviewed until data were saturated. A total of sixty-two patient records were analyzed, producing 6,327 sentences, this included 1,918 sentences on nursing phenomena (30.3\%) and 4,409 sentences on nursing action (69.7\%). The ratio between the two was about 1:2.3. Coded sentences were compared according to the four levels of applicability with the original records, each was identified as a "perfect fit", "conceptual fit", "partial fit", or "unable to fit". Of the 6,327 sentences, 2,041 (32.3\%) were designated as "perfect fit", 2,457 (38.8\%) as "conceptual fit", 1,663 (26.3\%) as "partial fit", and 166 (2.6\%) as "unable to fit". The top ten most described nursing phenomena included: acute pain, high temperature, conscious change, potential infection risk, state of mind change, potential risk patient's mobility change endurance level, gastrointestinal function obstacles, changes in urination, anxiety, and diarrhea. The top ten most described nursing actions included: observe surgical wounds, monitor vital signs, changes of mentality, instruction on medication, arranging clinical check ups, wound infection prevention, urinary drainage tube and urine nature observation, checking for vaginal drainage, pre/post-operative healthcare, and discharge planning. Study results indicated that 71.1\% of sentences could be cross-mapped. Further validation is suggested to validate ICNP in other gynecological hospitals.},

Its aim was to test the quantitative component of Coombs's (1964) theory via an empirical application to subjective control in gambling behavior (Dickerson and Baron, 2000). It was found that approximately 96\% of judgments upon bilateral stimulus pairs were as predicted by the theory of unidimensional unfolding. The double cancellation axiom of the theory of axiomatic conjoint measurement (ACM) (Krantz, Luce, Suppes and Tversky, 1971) was satisfied by the interstimulus midpoint order obtained from these judgments. These results supported previous unfolding studies on attitudes (Johnson, 2001; Michell, 1994). Exponential and linear relationships were found between the transformed scaling solutions of Coombs's (1964) theory and the SHCMpp (Andrich, 1995). The implications of these results were discussed. Additionally, the article presented both a formal theory of item construction (Michell, 1994) and an accessible demonstration of the Goode's algorithm scaling procedure.},

This paper is the first of a three part series; and it aims to introduce unidimensional unfolding theory. The paper begins with a simple hypothetical example presenting an idealised distinction between responses to cumulative and unfolding dichotomous items. This followed by an accessible presentation of the theory of unidimensional unfolding as first articulated by Clyde H. Coombs (1950, 1964). The concept of the single peaked preference function (Coombs and Avrunin, 1977) which underpins unfolding theory is then presented. The article then progresses to the class of Rasch (1960) based IRT models developed by Andrich (1995) and Luo (2001). It was shown these models propose arguments not inconsistent with Coombs's (1964) original theory. The presumption of additive structure in psychological attributes was concluded to be the key weakness of the theories of unidimensional unfolding discussed.},

Strong Dirichlet model support for both the ordinal and quantitative components of unfolding was only found in datasets that satisfied at least double cancellation. In contrast, the Item Response Theory (IRT) simple hyperbolic cosine model for pairwise preferences (SHCMpp, Andrich 1995) fitted all datasets.

For many years it has been argued the Rasch model is conjoint measurement by several psychometricians. This paper critiques this argument from the perspective of representational measurement theory. It concludes that the Rasch model is not conjoint measurement as the model does not demonstrate the existence of a representation theorem between an empirical relational structure and a numerical relational structure. Psychologists seriously interested in investigating traits for quantitative structure should use the theory of conjoint measurement itself rather than the Rasch model. This is not to say, however, that empirical relationships between conjoint measurement and the Rasch model are precluded. The paper concludes by suggesting some relevant research avenues.},

However, they prefer to model item response probabilities than to study the internal structure of cognitive attributes. The theory of conjoint measurement, via its unique capacity to detect the quantitative structure of non-extensive attributes, can be used for the latter purpose. It is shown that conjoint systems analogous to the numerical composition rules advanced by the Rasch, many facet Rasch and two-parameter logistic models can be formulated using well-established axioms, representation theorems and proofs. Examples using empirical and synthetic data are presented.

  abstract = {The measurement of pupil diameter in psychology (in short, �pupillometry�) has just celebrated 50 years. The method established itself after the appearance of three seminal studies (Hess \& Polt, 1960, 1964; Kahneman \& Beatty, 1966). Since then, the method has continued to play a significant role within the field, and pupillary responses have been successfully used to provide an estimate of the �intensity� of mental activity and of changes in mental states, particularly changes in the allocation of attention and the consolidation of perception. Remarkably, pupillary responses provide a continuous measure regardless of whether the participant is aware of such changes. More recently, research in neuroscience has revealed a tight correlation between the activity of the locus coeruleus (i.e., the �hub� of the noradrenergic system) and pupillary dilation. As we discuss in this short review, these neurophysiological findings provide new important insights to the meaning of pupillary responses for mental activity. Finally, given that pupillary responses can be easily measured in a noninvasive manner, occur from birth, and can occur in the absence of voluntary, conscious processes, they constitute a very promising tool for the study of preverbal (e.g., infants) or nonverbal participants (e.g., animals, neurological patients).},

Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 28, 776-788]. Their responses to potentially self-threatening experiences subsequently were rated for the extent to which they reflected openness and honesty as opposed to defensiveness. Our findings indicated that authenticity and mindfulness correlated positively and that higher scores on each related to lower levels of verbal defensiveness. Additional analyses revealed that the relation between authenticity and verbal defensiveness was indirect, mediated by mindfulness. These findings support the view that higher authenticity and mindfulness relate to greater tendencies to engage self-relevant information in a relatively non-defensive manner.},

It explains inconsistencies in probe studies of attention and fear conditioning and provides a new approach to emotional perception, imagery, and memory. Emotions are organized biphasically, as appetitive or aversive (defensive). Reflexes with the same valence as an ongoing emotional state are augmented; mismatched reflexes are inhibited. Thus, the startle response (an aversive reflex) is enhanced during a fear state and is diminished in a pleasant emotional context. This affect-startle effect is not determined by general arousal, simple attention, or probe modality. The effect is found when affects are prompted by pictures or memory images, changes appropriately with aversive conditioning, and may be dependent on right-hemisphere processing. Implications for clinical, neurophysiological, and basic research in emotion are outlined.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Pathological gambling is a behavioural addiction with negative economic, social, and psychological consequences. Identification of contributing genes and pathways may improve understanding of aetiology and facilitate therapy and prevention. Here, we report the first genome-wide association study of pathological gambling. Our aims were to identify pathways involved in pathological gambling, and examine whether there is a genetic overlap between pathological gambling and alcohol dependence. METHODS Four hundred and forty-five individuals with a diagnosis of pathological gambling according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders were recruited in Germany, and 986 controls were drawn from a German general population sample. A genome-wide association study of pathological gambling comprising single marker, gene-based, and pathway analyses, was performed. Polygenic risk scores were generated using data from a German genome-wide association study of alcohol dependence. RESULTS No genome-wide significant association with pathological gambling was found for single markers or genes. Pathways for Huntington's disease (P-value=6.63×10(-3)); 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signalling (P-value=9.57×10(-3)); and apoptosis (P-value=1.75×10(-2)) were significant. Polygenic risk score analysis of the alcohol dependence dataset yielded a one-sided nominal significant P-value in subjects with pathological gambling, irrespective of comorbid alcohol dependence status. CONCLUSIONS The present results accord with previous quantitative formal genetic studies which showed genetic overlap between non-substance- and substance-related addictions. Furthermore, pathway analysis suggests shared pathology between Huntington's disease and pathological gambling. This finding is consistent with previous imaging studies.},

The spontaneous, creative, mindful use of previously learned information, however, tends to be atypical. Three studies were designed to assess whether the manner in which information is initially presented affects how such information will subsequently be used, that is, in a mindful or mindless way. More specifically, two experiments (one with children, the other with college students) were conducted to compare the effects of a conditional versus absolute form of teaching upon creativity. Results revealed that instruction presented in an absolute manner resulted in mindless use of the information for both age groups. In contrast, subjects who were taught in a conditional way were better able to creatively deal with the information. For the college students, this finding was obtained even when the absolute learning condition was concerned with theoretical (i.e., conditional) information. In a third experiment, student teachers were taught conditionally or unconditionally in a confident or unconfident manner. Results indicated that confident but conditional instruction was most effective in provoking subsequent mindfulness.},

  abstract = {The growth rate of scientific publication has been studied from 1907 to 2007 using available data from a number of literature databases, including Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI). Traditional scientific publishing, that is publication in peer-reviewed journals, is still increasing although there are big differences between fields. There are no indications that the growth rate has decreased in the last 50 years. At the same time publication using new channels, for example conference proceedings, open archives and home pages, is growing fast. The growth rate for SCI up to 2007 is smaller than for comparable databases. This means that SCI was covering a decreasing part of the traditional scientific literature. There are also clear indications that the coverage by SCI is especially low in some of the scientific areas with the highest growth rate, including computer science and engineering sciences. The role of conference proceedings, open access archives and publications published on the net is increasing, especially in scientific fields with high growth rates, but this has only partially been reflected in the databases. The new publication channels challenge the use of the big databases in measurements of scientific productivity or output and of the growth rate of science. Because of the declining coverage and this challenge it is problematic that SCI has been used and is used as the dominant source for science indicators based on publication and citation numbers. The limited data available for social sciences show that the growth rate in SSCI was remarkably low and indicate that the coverage by SSCI was declining over time. National Science Indicators from Thomson Reuters is based solely on SCI, SSCI and Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). Therefore the declining coverage of the citation databases problematizes the use of this source.},

As predicted, Ss were less likely to report the smoke when in the presence of passive others (10\%) or in groups of 3 (38\% of groups) than when alone (75\%). This result seemed to have been mediated by the way Ss interpreted the ambiguous situation; seeing other people remain passive led Ss to decide the smoke was not dangerous.

In study 1 adult females (n = 196; mean age = 21 yrs) completed the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TEFQ-R21), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and a measure of dispositional mindfulness. In study 2 adult females (n = 190; mean age = 26 yrs) completed the same measures as in study 1 with the addition of the Barratt Impulsivity Scale. In both studies it was predicted that mindfulness would be negatively related to trait disinhibition controlling for adverse psychological symptoms. The second study addressed the additional hypothesis that the relationship between mindfulness and trait disinhibition would be mediated by impulsivity. Regression analyses indicated that mindfulness was negatively related to and explained 11\% of variation in trait disinhibition (study 1). This relationship was replicated and extended in study 2 whereby impulsivity mediated the relationship between mindfulness and trait disinhibition. The findings warrant experimental and in vivo investigations of the potential causal relationships between mindfulness, impulsivity and eating behaviours.},

  abstract = {Previous research indicates that long-term meditation practice is associated with altered resting electroencephalogram patterns, suggestive of long lasting changes in brain activity. We hypothesized that meditation practice might also be associated with changes in the brain's physical structure. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess cortical thickness in 20 participants with extensive Insight meditation experience, which involves focused attention to internal experiences. Brain regions associated with attention, interoception and sensory processing were thicker in meditation participants than matched controls, including the prefrontal cortex and right anterior insula. Between-group differences in prefrontal cortical thickness were most pronounced in older participants, suggesting that meditation might offset age-related cortical thinning. Finally, the thickness of two regions correlated with meditation experience. These data provide the first structural evidence for experience-dependent cortical plasticity associated with meditation practice.},

The 2nd main task is to apply an analysis of appraisal patterns and the core relational themes that they produce to a number of commonly identified emotions. Anger, anxiety, sadness, and pride (to include 1 positive emotion) are used as illustrations. The purpose is to show the capability of a cognitive-motivational-relational theory to explain and predict the emotions. The role of coping in emotion is also discussed, and the article ends with a response to criticisms of a phenomenological, folk-theory outlook.},

This assumption has been challenged conceptually and empirically, but results to date have been inconclusive. In the current study, we took a theory-driven approach in systematically addressing this issue. Results based on two different samples generally supported our expectations of the curvilinear relationships between personality traits, including Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability, and job performance dimensions, including task performance, organizational citizenship behavior, and counterproductive work behaviors. We also hypothesized and found that job complexity moderated the curvilinear personality--performance relationships such that the inflection points after which the relationships disappear were lower for low-complexity jobs than they were for high-complexity jobs. This finding suggests that high levels of the two personality traits examined are more beneficial for performance in high- than low-complexity jobs. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for the use of personality in personnel selection.},

  abstract = {The Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) is a popular tool in mindfulness research. However, its psychometric qualities and its replicability have caused controversy. This study carried out a psychometric review and a conceptual replication of the FFMQ latent structure. The review showed that previous validation studies of the FFMQ used nonoptimal methods. In addition, this conceptual replication study tested the structure of the FFMQ using frequentist and Bayesian techniques. The original structure did not provide a good fit with both techniques, while the proposed alternative provided mixed results. We also found systematic fit improvements in both techniques when the Observe facet was excluded and method factors were included. With these findings, we conclude that the conceptual replication of the FFMQ’s structure failed. Alternatively, we propose a new provisional FFMQ model with a set of recommendations regarding its application. Future research proposals on improving techniques and models toward mindfulness assessment are also presented and discussed.},

The purpose of this study is to examine the scale properties (hierarchical structure and unidimensionality) of the VF-14 using Rasch item response theory methodology in cataract patients (N = 80). The results of the study showed that the Korean version VF-14 is unidimensional with a hierarchy from easy to hard items, as well as being valid and reliable in the terms of traditional psychometric analysis. The Korean version of the VF-14 had some significant item spacings (three strata), and the rating-scale categories were worded well. Therefore, the Korean version of the VF-14 measures are appropriate for use in and further study of the visual limitations associated with cataract inpatients.

Using mapping methodology, this study validates that both NIC and ICNP would be useful for documenting nursing care in a Korean hospital, but it also identifies additional concepts that need to be represented in both of these standardized nursing languages. It is recommended that nurses be more careful in documenting their interventions and also that SNLs be developed further to more completely represent nursing practice.},

Our analysis of data from the popular Web site HOTorNOT.com suggests that this is not the case: Less attractive people do not delude themselves into thinking that their dates are more physically attractive than others perceive them to be. Furthermore, the results also show that males, compared with females, are less affected by their own attractiveness when choosing whom to date.},

  abstract = {Over the past 2 years, increased focus on statistical analysis brought on by the era of big data has pushed the issue of reproducibility out of the pages of academic journals and into the popular consciousness (1). Just weeks ago, a paper about the relationship between tissue-specific cancer incidence and stem cell divisions (2) was widely misreported because of misunderstandings about the primary statistical argument in the paper (3). Public pressure has contributed to the massive recent adoption of reproducible research tools, with corresponding improvements in reproducibility. But an analysis can be fully reproducible and still be wrong. Even the most spectacularly irreproducible analyses—like those underlying the ongoing lawsuits (4) over failed genomic signatures for chemotherapy assignment (5)—are ultimately reproducible (6). Once an analysis is reproducible, the key question we want to answer is, “Is this data analysis correct?” We have found that the most frequent failure in data analysis is mistaking the type of question being considered. Mistaking the type of question being considered is the most common error in data analysis Mistaking the type of question being considered is the most common error in data analysis},

  abstract = {In 1885, Sir Francis Galton first defined the term “regression” and completed the theory of bivariate correlation. A decade later, Karl Pearson developed the index that we still use to measure correlation, Pearson's r. Our article is written in recognition of the 100th anniversary of Galton's first discussion of regression and correlation. We begin with a brief history. Then we present 13 different formulas, each of which represents a different computational and conceptual definition of r. Each formula suggests a different way of thinking about this index, from algebraic, geometric, and trigonometric settings. We show that Pearson's r (or simple functions of r) may variously be thought of as a special type of mean, a special type of variance, the ratio of two means, the ratio of two variances, the slope of a line, the cosine of an angle, and the tangent to an ellipse, and may be looked at from several other interesting perspectives.}

  abstract = {Psychometric data of bipolar scales are commonly used in medical and economic psychology. Recently, their compositional structure (the Simplex) was revealed. Disregarding the Simplex causes serious bias, e.g., while estimating correlations or psychometric standards. The isometric log-ratio (ilr) transformation converts Simplex data towards the interval scale and provides unbiased statistical results. The ilr approach increases the statistical power of the well-known correlation test based on Student’s t-distribution if the prerequisites of the central limit theorem (CLT) are fulfilled. Concerning ilr transformed data, the CLT is applicable if and only if the number of summands is sufficiently large and the data generating process (DGP) provides finite variance. In practice, however, the number of items of a questionnaire often is small and the DGP could be heavy-tailed. By means of a simulation study, this paper shows that the ilr approach works satisfactory if the DGP is heavy-tailed with finite (Laplace) or infinite (Cauchy) variance. A violation of the CLT hardly affects the results of the ilr approach. The results of the simulation study generalize from correlation analysis towards a larger set of standard statistical procedures, e.g. linear regression, two-sample t-test and partial least squares structural equation modeling.},

  abstract = {Correct psychometric profiling and the choice of adequate therapeutic measures are the basis of any psychotherapeutic treatment. The preparation of a correct psychological profile benefits the patient and saves time and costs. Regarding psychometric questionnaires it is common practice to consider data of bipolar scales as interval scaled. This paper reveals the true compositional data structure (namely the Simplex) with respect to the psychometric limit of quantification of bipolar traits and constructs. The Simplex heavily affects the set of statistical procedures applicable. Disregarding the Simplex causes serious bias and results in erroneous standards and standard deviations, biased correlations, reduced convergent validity and a loss of statistical power. In this paper, the isometric log-ratio (ilr) transformation is suggested. It transforms Simplex data towards the interval scale and provides unbiased results, e.g., standards. By means of a simulation study, this paper shows that up to an 18\textbackslash\% increase in the statistical power of the well-known correlation test based on Student's t-distribution can be achieved. As the statistical power increases the sample size of psychometric studies can be reduced resulting in lower data collection costs. Besides economic and psychotherapeutic aspects, the results of the simulation study generalize from correlation analysis towards a larger set of standard statistical procedures. For example, testing the hypothesis of equality of the two means of independent samples using a t-test based on Student's t distribution is equivalent to testing the hypothesis of a null-correlation between the binary grouping variable and the dependent variable. Furthermore, the coefficient of correlation contributes to the slope of a regression line. Thus, the ilr approach also affects linear regression techniques.},

AIM The aim of this study was to validate the ICF Core Set for stroke from the perspective of physicians. DESIGN Observational. SETTING Other. POPULATION Physicians experienced in stroke treatment. METHODS Physicians experienced in stroke treatment were asked about the patients' problems, patients' resources and aspects of environment that physicians take care of in a three-round electronic mail survey using the Delphi technique. The responses were linked to the ICF by two persons. The degree of agreement was calculated using Kappa statistic. RESULTS Eighty-eight physicians in 30 countries named 2142 patients' problems that covered all ICF components. Two hundred seventy-seven ICF categories were linked to these. Kappa statistic for agreement reached 0.68 with a 95\% confidence interval of 0.66-0.69. Although 28 ICF categories were not represented in the ICF Core Set for stroke, only four of them were considered as important by at least 75\% of the participants. Those categories addressed sensations associated with cardiovascular and respiratory functions, urinary excretory functions, involuntary movement functions and sensations related to muscle and movement functions. CONCLUSION The validity of the ICF components Body structures, Activities and Participation, and Environ-mental Factors was fully supported. Only some body functions were identified that were not covered and need to be investigated further.},

As each of the contributing authors to this special section suggests, much more theoretical and empirical work is in order if the impact of individual differences in self-monitoring for the phenomena reviewed here is to be fully appreciated. Moreover, the four domains of interest represented in this special section by no means exhaust the areas to which theorists and researchers have applied or can apply the psychology of individual differences in self-monitoring. Given the large nomological network that currently exists involving the self-monitoring construct, it is anticipated that the breadth and depth of applications of the psychology of self-monitoring will only continue to expand as it has in the last 30 years since the appearance of the construct in the literature.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Data on endoscopic resection of sporadic duodenal adenoma (SDA) are sparse; wepresent our results concerning safety and effi− cacy in a retrospective analysis of saline−assisted endoscopic resection of SDA. Patients and methods: The cases of all patients who underwent endoscopic resection for SDA be− tween May 1998 and May 2006 were analyzed. Endoscopic resection was carried out using standard injection and cut methods. In some pa− tients hemoclips and argon plasma coagulation were used, either for prophylaxis or for the treat− ment of procedure−related bleeding. Results: Thirty−six patients with a total of 37 le− sions (mean size 19mm, range 4?50mm) were analyzed. Lesions larger than 20mm were more frequently resected piecemeal (P = 0.022). Intra− procedural bleeding occurred in 14\% of cases, without any significant association with lesion size or the resection technique. One fatal perforation occurred. Macroscopically complete resec− tion was achieved in 97\% of cases, as confirmed by at least one negative control endoscopy with biopsies after a mean follow−up of 15 months. Al− though clipping and argon plasma coagulation were not applied in any systematic way, it was noticeable that in the 20 cases in which they were used for hemostasis or prevention, no de− layed bleeding was observed after the proce− dures. In contrast, bleeding occurred in 22\% of the 23 procedures performed without these ad− ditional techniques. Conclusion: Endoscopic resection is an efficient and acceptably safe technique for treating SDA. Further studies need to assess whether systema− tic bleeding prophylaxis will reduce the inci− dence of delayed hemorrhage after endoscopic resection.},

In two studies, we tested the hypothesis that cognitive reappraisal could be used to successfully resist temptation. Participants had to memorize tedious material while being tempted by pictures pasted on the wall (Study 1) or by funny clips on the television (Study 2). In Study 1, compared to a control group, participants who were instructed to reappraise the task as an opportunity to improve their memory (1) were less tempted by the pictures, (2) maintained their enthusiasm for the task, and (3) showed better performance in a subsequent memory test. Study 2 replicated and extended the findings from Study 1, showing that cognitive reappraisal is effective whether the target of reappraisal is the temptation itself, or the longer term goal. Taken together, our findings provide compelling evidence that cognitive reappraisal (of either the task or the temptation) may be a useful tool for increasing students' task performance and enthusiasm. © 2011 Elsevier Inc..},

Functional outcomes assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), Dougados Functional Index (FI), and the physical functioning scale of the Medical Outcome Study Short-form 36 (SF-36-PF) were analyzed by the Rasch model for item fit, item separation, measurement span, and distribution properties. Patient subgroups with axial or peripheral disease were analyzed for differential item functioning (DIF).One hundred eight patients with PsA were assessed. The 4 functional indexes were highly correlated with each other and moderately correlated with patients' perception of health and pain scores. Floor effects were less marked in SF-36-PF. The 4 indexes satisfied the unidimensionality assumption of the Rasch model. HAQ and SF-36-PF had better information-weighted fit statistics (INFIT) and outlier-sensitive (OUTFIT) statistics. HAQ had the poorest item separation. SF-36-PF had the highest item separation (6.99), reliability (0.85), and the longest span of item threshold (9.03 logits). Only 1 and 2 items in BASFI and Dougados-FI had DIF in patients with sacroiliitis.HAQ, BASFI, Dougados-FI, and SF-36-PF provide unidimensional measures of functional disability in PsA. SF-36-PF was the best in terms of less floor effect, highest item separation, longest span of item threshold, and better distributional properties. BASFI and Dougados-FI behaved similarly in patients with and without sacroiliitis and conferred no superiority in patients with axial disease.}

  abstract = {This paper outlines a new approach to the study of bystander intervention. Using insights derived from self-categorization theory (Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, \& Wetherell, 1987), we explore the social category relations among those present in the context of physical violence. The paper describes two experiments that manipulate the social category relations between (a) bystander and fellow bystanders, and (b) bystander and victim. Analysis indicates that fellow bystanders are only influential when they are in-group rather than out-group members. Furthermore, bystanders are more likely to help victims who are described as in-group as opposed to out-group members. Overall, the findings suggest an important role for a self-categorization perspective in developing strategies to promote bystander intervention.},

  abstract = {Working memory is crucial for many higher-level cognitive functions, ranging from mental arithmetic to reasoning and problem solving. Likewise, the ability to learn and categorize novel concepts forms an indispensable part of human cognition. However, very little is known about the relationship between working memory and categorization, and modeling in category learning has thus far been largely uninformed by knowledge about people's memory processes. This article reports a large study (N = 113) that related people's working memory capacity (WMC) to their category-learning performance using the 6 problem types of Shepard, Hovland, and Jenkins (1961). Structural equation modeling revealed a strong relationship between WMC and category learning, with a single latent variable accommodating performance on all 6 problems. A model of categorization (ALCOVE) was fit to the individual data and a single latent variable was sufficient to capture the variation among associative learning parameters across all problems. The data and modeling suggest that working memory mediates category learning across a broad range of tasks.},

  abstract = {Objective To assess versions of the shorter form variant of Usability Metric for User Experience (UMUX-LITE) questionnaire differing in the number of response options for the items (3, 5, 7, and 11). Background The UMUX-LITE is an efficient (two-item) standardized questionnaire that measures perceived usability. A growing body of evidence shows it closely corresponds to one of the most widely used standardized usability questionnaires, the System Usability Scale (SUS), with regard to both correlation and magnitude of concurrently collected means. Although the “standard” version of the UMUX-LITE uses items with seven response options, there is some variance in practice. Method Members of a corporate user experience panel ( n = 242) completed surveys rating a recent Web site experience with the SUS and UMUX-LITE, also providing ratings of overall experience and likelihood-to-recommend. Results Scale reliabilities were acceptable (coefficient α {$>$}.70) with the exception of UMUX-LITE with three response options. All UMUX-LITE correlations with SUS, overall experience, and likelihood-to-recommend were highly significant. For likelihood-to-recommend, there was a significant difference in the magnitude of correlations, with 11 response options higher than three. Although some statistically significant differences were observed in correspondence between SUS and UMUX-LITE scores, these did not seem to translate to practically significant differences. Conclusion The number of UMUX-LITE response options does not matter much, especially in practice. Because the version with three response options showed some weakness with regard to reliability and correlation with likelihood-to-recommend, practitioners should avoid it. Application Unless there is a strong reason to do otherwise, use the “standard” version with seven response options.}

In boosting, successive trees give extra weight to points incorrectly predicted by earlier predictors. In the end, a weighted vote is taken for prediction. In bagging, successive trees do not depend on earlier trees --- each is independently constructed using a bootstrap sample of the data set.

  abstract = {Abstract             Voluntary acts are preceded by electrophysiological “readiness potentials” (RPs). With spontaneous acts involving no preplanning, the main negative RP shift begins at about—550 ms. Such RPs were used to indicate the minimum onset times for the cerebral activity that precedes a fully endogenous voluntary act. The time of conscious intention to act was obtained from the subject's recall of the spatial clock position of a revolving spot at the time of his initial awareness of intending or wanting to move (W). W occurred at about—200 ms. Control experiments, in which a skin stimulus was timed (S), helped evaluate each subject's error in reporting the clock times for awareness of any perceived event.             For spontaneous voluntary acts, RP onset preceded the uncorrected Ws by about 350 ms and the Ws corrected for S by about 400 ms. The direction of this difference was consistent and significant throughout, regardless of which of several measures of RP onset or W were used. It was concluded that cerebral initiation of a spontaneous voluntary act begins unconsciously. However, it was found that the final decision to act could still be consciously controlled during the 150 ms or so remaining after the specific conscious intention appears. Subjects can in fact “veto” motor performance during a 100–200-ms period before a prearranged time to act.             The role of conscious will would be not to initiate a specific voluntary act but rather to select and control volitional outcome. It is proposed that conscious will can function in a permissive fashion, either to permit or to prevent the motor implementation of the intention to act that arises unconsciously. Alternatively, there may be the need for a conscious activation or triggering, without which the final motor output would not follow the unconscious cerebral initiating and preparatory processes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although abortion or termination of pregnancy (TOP) has become an increasingly normalized component of women's health care over the past forty years, insufficient attention has been paid to women's experiences of surgical or medical methods of TOP. OBJECTIVE: To undertake a narrative review of qualitative studies of women's experiences of TOP and their perspectives on surgical or medical methods. METHODS: Keyword searches of Medline, CINAHL, ISI, and IBSS databases. Manual searches of other relevant journals and reference lists of primary articles. RESULTS: Qualitative studies (n = 18) on women's experiences of abortion were identified. Analysis of the results of studies reviewed revealed three main themes: experiential factors that promote or inhibit the choice to seek TOP; experiences of TOP; and experiential aspects of the environment in which TOP takes place. CONCLUSION: Women's choices about TOP are mainly pragmatic ones that are related to negotiating finite personal and family and emotional resources. Women who are well informed and supported in their choices experience good psychosocial outcomes from TOP. Home TOP using mifepristone appears attractive to women who are concerned about professionals' negative attitudes and lack of privacy in formal healthcare settings but also leads to concerns about management and safety.},

  abstract = {Rating scales are employed as a means of extracting more information out of an item than would be obtained from a mere “yes/no”, “right/wrong” or other dichotomy. But does this additional information increase measurement accuracy and precision? Eight guidelines are suggested to aid the analyst in optimizing the manner in which rating scales categories cooperate in order to improve the utility of the resultant measures. Though these guidelines are presented within the context of Rasch analysis, they reflect aspects of rating scale functioning which impact all methods of analysis. The guidelines feature rating-scale-based data such as category frequency, ordering, rating-to-measure inferential coherence, and the quality of the scale from measurement and statistical perspectives. The manner in which the guidelines prompt recategorization or reconceptualization of the rating scale is indicated. Utilization of the guidelines is illustrated through their application to two published data sets.}

This article reviews research conducted in the last 25 years about meditation and spirituality, in particular as it relates to the health of the elderly. This review supports the hypothesis that meditation can be taught to the elderly, even those with dementia. The results also support the hypothesis that meditation and spiritual practices could promote significant social and emotional benefits for those in social isolation. Specific treatment plan interventions for nursing homes are discussed. Future research should investigate the effectiveness of various types of meditative and spiritual practices to nursing home residents.}

Patients were treated at 18 outpatient centers in Germany.Interventions Acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or waiting list control. Acupuncture and sham acupuncture were administered by specialized physicians and consisted of 12 sessions per patient over 8 weeks. Patients completed headache diaries from 4 weeks before to 12 weeks after randomization and from week 21 to 24 after randomization.Main Outcome Measures Difference in headache days of moderate or severe intensity between the 4 weeks before and weeks 9 to 12 after randomization.Results Between baseline and weeks 9 to 12, the mean (SD) number of days with headache of moderate or severe intensity decreased by 2.2 (2.7) days from a baseline of 5.2 (2.5) days in the acupuncture group compared with a decrease to 2.2 (2.7) days from a baseline of 5.0 (2.4) days in the sham acupuncture group, and by 0.8 (2.0) days from a baseline if 5.4 (3.0) days in the waiting list group. No difference was detected between the acupuncture and the sham acupuncture groups (0.0 days, 95\% confidence interval, −0.7 to 0.7 days; P = .96) while there was a difference between the acupuncture group compared with the waiting list group (1.4 days; 95\% confidence interval; 0.8-2.1 days; P{$<$}.001). The proportion of responders (reduction in headache days by at least 50\%) was 51\% in the acupuncture group, 53\% in the sham acupuncture group, and 15\% in the waiting list group.Conclusion Acupuncture was no more effective than sham acupuncture in reducing migraine headaches although both interventions were more effective than a waiting list control.}

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a treatment for suicidal behavior and borderline personality disorder with well-documented efficacy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hypothesis that unique aspects of DBT are more efficacious compared with treatment offered by non-behavioral psychotherapy experts. DESIGN: One-year randomized controlled trial, plus 1 year of posttreatment follow-up. SETTING: University outpatient clinic and community practice. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred one clinically referred women with recent suicidal and self-injurious behaviors meeting DSM-IV criteria, matched to condition on age, suicide attempt history, negative prognostic indication, and number of lifetime intentional self-injuries and psychiatric hospitalizations. INTERVENTION: One year of DBT or 1 year of community treatment by experts (developed to maximize internal validity by controlling for therapist sex, availability, expertise, allegiance, training and experience, consultation availability, and institutional prestige). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Trimester assessments of suicidal behaviors, emergency services use, and general psychological functioning. Measures were selected based on previous outcome studies of DBT. Outcome variables were evaluated by blinded assessors. RESULTS: Dialectical behavior therapy was associated with better outcomes in the intent-to-treat analysis than community treatment by experts in most target areas during the 2-year treatment and follow-up period. Subjects receiving DBT were half as likely to make a suicide attempt (hazard ratio, 2.66; P = .005), required less hospitalization for suicide ideation (F(1,92) = 7.3; P = .004), and had lower medical risk (F(1,50) = 3.2; P = .04) across all suicide attempts and self-injurious acts combined. Subjects receiving DBT were less likely to drop out of treatment (hazard ratio, 3.2; P {$<$} .001) and had fewer psychiatric hospitalizations (F(1,92) = 6.0; P = .007) and psychiatric emergency department visits (F(1,92) = 2.9; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings replicate those of previous studies of DBT and suggest that the effectiveness of DBT cannot reasonably be attributed to general factors associated with expert psychotherapy. Dialectical behavior therapy appears to be uniquely effective in reducing suicide attempts.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Knowledge concerning the applicability and the effect of high-intensity exercise programs is very limited for older people with severe cognitive and physical impairments. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of a high-intensity functional weight-bearing exercise program among older people who are dependent in activities of daily living and living in residential care facilities. A second aim was to analyze whether cognitive function was associated with the applicability of the program. SUBJECTS: The subjects were 91 older people (mean age=85.3 years, SD=6.1, range=68-100) who were dependent in personal activities of daily living and randomly assigned to participate in an exercise intervention. Their mean score for the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was 17.5 (SD=5.0, range=10-29). METHODS: A high-intensity functional weight-bearing exercise program was performed in groups of 3 to 7 participants who were supervised by physical therapists. There were 29 exercise sessions over 13 weeks. Attendance, intensity of lower-limb strength and balance exercises, and occurrence and seriousness of adverse events were the outcome variables in evaluating the applicability of the program. RESULTS: The median attendance rate was 76\%. Lower-limb strength exercises with high intensity were performed in a median of 53\% of the attended exercise sessions, and balance exercises with high intensity were performed in a median of 73\% of the attended exercise sessions. The median rate of sessions with adverse events was 5\%. All except 2 adverse events were assessed as minor and temporary, and none led to manifest injury or disease. No significant differences were observed in applicability when comparing participants with dementia and participants without dementia. In addition, there was no significant correlation between applicability and the MMSE score. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The results suggest that a high-intensity functional weight-bearing exercise program is applicable for use, regardless of cognitive function, among older people who are dependent in activities of daily living, living in residential care facilities, and have an MMSE score of 10 or higher.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To measure patients' perceptions of patient centredness and the relation of these perceptions to outcomes.: Observational study using questionnaires.: Three general practices.: 865 consecutive patients attending the practices. OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients' enablement, satisfaction, and burden of symptoms.: Factor analysis identified five components. These were communication and partnership (a sympathetic doctor interested in patients' worries and expectations and who discusses and agrees the problem and treatment, Cronbach's alpha=0.96); personal relationship (a doctor who knows the patient and their emotional needs, alpha=0.89); health promotion (alpha=0.87); positive approach (being definite about the problem and when it would settle, alpha=0.84); and interest in effect on patient's life (alpha=0.89). Satisfaction was related to communication and partnership (adjusted beta=19.1; 95\% confidence interval 17.7 to 20.7) and a positive approach (4.28; 2.96 to 5.60). Enablement was greater with interest in the effect on life (0.55; 0.25 to 0.86), health promotion (0.57; 0.30 to 0.85), and a positive approach (0.82; 0.52 to 1.11). A positive approach was also associated with reduced symptom burden at one month (beta=-0.25; -0.41 to -0.10). Referrals were fewer if patients felt they had a personal relationship with their doctor (odds ratio 0.70; 0.54 to 0.90).: Components of patients' perceptions can be measured reliably and predict different outcomes. If doctors don't provide a positive, patient centred approach patients will be less satisfied, less enabled, and may have greater symptom burden and higher rates of referral.},

  abstract = {We examine the controversial practice of using parcels of items as manifest variables in structural equation modeling (SEM) procedures. After detailing arguments pro and con, we conclude that the unconsidered use of parcels is never warranted, while, at the same time, the considered use of parcels cannot be dismissed out of hand. In large part, the decision to parcel or not depends on one's philosophical stance regarding scientific inquiry (e.g., empiricist vs. pragmatist) and the substantive goal of a study (e.g., to understand the structure of a set of items or to examine the nature of a set of constructs). Prior to creating parcels, however, we recommend strongly that investigators acquire a thorough understanding of the nature and dimensionality of the items to be parceled. With this knowledge in hand, various techniques for creating parcels can be utilized to minimize potential pitfalls and to optimize the measurement structure of constructs in SEM procedures. A number of parceling techniques are described, noting their strengths and weaknesses. Using parcels as indicators of constructs in structural equation models (SEMs) has been and remains a controversial practice. Historically, debates on the utility and efficacy of parcels date back over 40 years (e.g., Cattell, 1956; Cattell \& Burdsal, 1975), and the debates have continued in contemporary SEM circles (e.g.,},

  abstract = {Nowadays, millions of people around the world use social networking sites to express everyday thoughts and feelings. Many researchers have tried to make use of social media to study users' online behaviors and psychological states. However, previous studies show mixed results about whether self-generated contents on Facebook reflect users' subjective well-being (SWB). This study analyzed Facebook status updates to determine the extent to which users' emotional expression predicted their SWB---specifically their self-reported satis- faction with life. It was found that positive emotional expressions on Facebook did not correlate with life satisfaction, whereas negative emotional expressions within the past 9--10 months (but not beyond) were significantly related to life satisfaction. These findings suggest that both the type of emotional expressions and the time frame of status updates determine whether emotional expressions in Facebook status updates can effectively reflect users' SWB. The findings shed light on the characteristics of online social media and improve the understanding of how user-generated contents reflect users' psychological states.},

  abstract = {The essential character of what is classically considered, e.g., by N. R. Campbell, the fundamental measurement of extensive quantities is described by an axiomatization for the comparision of effects of (or responses to) arbitrary combinations of “quantities” of a single specified kind. For example, the effect of placing one arbitrary combination of masses on a pan of a beam balance is compared with another arbitrary combination on the other pan. Measurement on a ratio scale follows from such axioms. In this paper, the essential character of simultaneous conjoint measurement is described by an axiomatization for the comparision of effects of (or responses to) pairs formed from two specified kinds of “quantities”. The axioms apply when, for example, the effect of a pair consisting of one mass and one difference in gravitational potential on a device that responds to momentum is compared with the effect of another such pair. Measurement on interval scales which have a common unit follows from these axioms; usually these scales can be converted in a natural way into ratio scales.},

Four hypotheses were tested with data from 12 public health nurses in school settings and 220 schoolchildren. Group A comprised six nurses who used SNAP Health Center (SNAP 98) software to record health visits with 117 children. Group B comprised six nurses who used the same software and NANDA, NIC, and NOC with 103 children. After use of the software, the power of the 12 nurses to help children significantly increased. For the 220 children, the number of coping strategies significantly increased but there were no changes in the other health outcomes. The hypotheses indicating that Group B nurses and children would have more positive changes than Group A were not supported. Positive and negative elements for large-scale studies were identified.

We measured the effect of three cognitive tasks (the psychomotor vigilance task, a temporal orienting task, and a duration discrimination task) on the heart rate variability of two groups of participants: a high-fit group and a low-fit group. Two major novel findings emerged from this study. First, the lowest values of heart rate variability were found during performance of the duration discrimination task, compared to the other two tasks. Second, the results showed a decrement in heart rate variability as a function of the time on task, although only in the low-fit group. Moreover, the high-fit group showed overall faster reaction times than the low-fit group in the psychomotor vigilance task, while there were not significant differences in performance between the two groups of participants in the other two cognitive tasks. In sum, our results highlighted the influence of cognitive processing on heart rate variability. Importantly, both behavioral and physiological results suggested that the main benefit obtained as a result of fitness level appeared to be associated with processes involving sustained attention.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Fibromyalgia, a chronic pain syndrome, is often accompanied by psychological distress and increased basal sympathetic tone. In a previous report it was shown that mindfulness-based stress-reduction (MBSR) reduced depressive symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia with gains maintained at two months follow-up (Sephton et al., Arthr Rheum 57:77-85, 2007). This second study explores the effects of MBSR on basal sympathetic (SNS) activation among women with fibromyalgia. METHODS: Participants (n = 24) responded to a television news appearance, newspaper, and radio advertisements. Effects on anxiety, depressive symptoms, and SNS activation measures were tested before and after MBSR using a within-subjects design. RESULTS: The MBSR treatment significantly reduced basal electrodermal (skin conductance level; SCL) activity (t = 3.298, p = .005) and SCL activity during meditation (t = 4.389, p = .001), consistent with reduced SNS activation. CONCLUSIONS: In this small sample, basal SNS activity was reduced following MBSR treatment. Future studies should assess how MBSR may help reduce negative psychological symptoms and attenuate SNS activation in fibromyalgia. Further clarification of psychological and physiological responses associated with fibromyalgia may lead to more beneficial treatment.},

  abstract = {Although mindfulness meditation traditionally is viewed as a lifelong practice, much current knowledge about its effects is based on short-term practitioners who have participated in mindfulness-based treatment. In the current study, long-term meditators and demographically similar nonmeditators completed self-report measures of constructs expected to be related to the practice of mindfulness meditation. Extent of meditation experience was correlated in the expected directions with levels of mindfulness and with many other variables. Mean differences between meditators and nonmeditators were significant in most cases. Mediation analyses were consistent with the hypothesis that practicing meditation is associated with increased mindfulness in daily life, which is related to decreased rumination, decreased fear of emotion, and increased behavioral self-regulation. These mechanisms appear partially responsible for the relationships between mindfulness skills and psychological adjustment. Overall, the current study suggests that the long-term practice of mindfulness meditation may cultivate mindfulness skills and promote adaptive functioning.},

  abstract = {Abstract The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of implementing a new 8-week mindfulness-based programme, `Mindfulness-Based Coping with University Life' (MBCUL), specifically tailored to the needs and demand of students and to explore its impact in a pilot evaluation. Participants were drawn from the University of Northampton (MBCUL N = 10; control N = 6). A non-randomized wait-list-controlled design was employed. Measures examined anxiety and depression, perceived stress, mindfulness and personally relevant change before and immediately after the programme. The diurnal profile of salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase level was collected for two consecutive days. No significant intergroup differences were observed on any of the measures at either time point. However, significant change was observed for the MBCUL group in terms of perceived stress (d = 1.06; z = −2.25, p = 0.03), anxiety (d = 1.04; z = −2.14, p = 0.03), depression (d = 0.52; z = −0.69, p = 0.5) and personally relevant change (d = 2.63; z = −2.68, p = 0.01), along with an increase in mindfulness (d = 1.06; z = −1.89, p = 0.06). In contrast, no significant change was found in the daily profiles of cortisol and alpha-amylase. The data from this pilot tentatively suggest that MBCUL appears to be a promising programme that warrants further evaluation using a randomized study with a larger sample size.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of large clinical datasets to assess the effectiveness of health care is of growing interest in continuing efforts to understand the impact of healthcare costs on quality. Correspondingly, there is a greater need to define and measure outcomes that are sensitive to nursing interventions. However, concerns exist about the ability to amass and use large clinical nursing datasets to assess the effectiveness of nursing interventions. Some nursing studies have used large clinical datasets to examine patterns of nursing diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes. Among patient populations, however, systematic effectiveness studies of nursing process and outcome linkages at the individual nurse and patient level of analysis are essentially nonexistent. This is largely the result of slow development of nursing classifications, reference terminologies, and reference information standards. Nursing information systems have an unprecedented potential for documentation of nursing practice, as well as the accumulation and analysis of large clinical datasets, to improve nursing performance, increase nursing knowledge, and provide data and information necessary for nursing to participate in the formulation of healthcare policy. OBJECTIVES: A literature search shows that a common framework is beginning to evolve that represents nursing's essential information, eg, the Nursing Minimum Data Set, Management Minimum Data Set, and several standardized nursing languages. Extensive research and other initiatives have produced 1) nursing languages and reference terminologies that span healthcare settings; 2) information models; and 3) standards for datasets supporting information systems. A number of issues remain, however, that concern the development of uniform nursing datasets, definitions of outcomes, quality of nursing data, information system design, and methods of data analysis. We review nursing process outcome research, clarify issues inherent in nursing effectiveness research, and discuss implications for nursing and health policy.},

By “statistical thinking” is meant a focus on ideas that statisticians care about as opposed to technical details of how to put those ideas into practice. By “likelihood emphasis” is meant that the likelihood function and likelihood principle are unifying ideas throughout the text. Another unusual aspect is the use of statistical software as a pedagogical tool. That is, instead of viewing the computer merely as a convenient and accurate calculating device, we use computer calculation and simulation as another way of explaining and helping readers understand the underlying concepts. Our software of choice is R (R Development Core Team [2006]). R and accompanying manuals are available for free download from http://www.r-project.org. You may wish to download An Introduction to R to keep as a reference. It is highly recommended that you try all the examples in R. They will help you understand concepts, give you a little programming experience, and give you facility with a very flexible statistical software package. And don't just try the examples as written. Vary them a little; play around with them; experiment. You won't hurt anything and you'll learn a lot.},

  abstract = {Techniques such as ballistocardiography (BCG) that can provide noninvasive long-term physiological monitoring have gained interest due to a growing recognition of adverse effects from poor sleep and sleep disorders. The noninvasive analysis of physiological signals (NAPS) system is a BCG-based monitoring system developed to measure heart rate, breathing rate, and musculoskeletal movement that shows promise as a general sleep analysis tool. Overnight sleep studies were conducted on 40 healthy subjects during a clinical trial at the University of Virginia. The NAPS system's measures of heart rate and breathing rate were compared to ECG, pulse oximetry, and respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP). The subjects were split into a training dataset and a validation dataset, maintaining similar demographics in each set. The NAPS system accurately detected heart rate, averaged over the prescribed 30-s epochs, to within less than 2.72 beats per minute of ECG, and accurately detected breathing rate, averaged over the same epochs, to within 2.10 breaths per minute of RIP bands used in polysomnography.},

It expects familiarity with calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra as taught in a rst- or secondyear undergraduate course on mathematics for scientists and engineers. Conventional courses on information theory cover not only the beautiful theoretical ideas of Shannon, but also practical solutions to communication problems. This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single eld, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems. And the state-of-the-art algorithms for both data compression and error-correcting codes use the same tools as machine learning.},

The nursing minimum data set (NMDS) has been proposed as a method of routinely collecting information on core aspects of the nursing contribution to care, organised primarily in terms of phenomena, interventions and outcomes. Potential applications in clinical nursing, healthcare management, education and research have been identified. NMDS systems have been developed in a number of countries, with applications mostly related to resource allocation. To date, NMDS systems have tended to examine physical nursing care provided in institutional settings, with implications for construct and content validity. While NMDS research helps to clarify the nursing contribution to care, attention is now required to better understand the domains of nursing care across a broader range of care settings.},

  abstract = {The linear factor analysis (FA) model is a popular tool for exploratory data analysis or, more precisely, for assessing the dimensionality of sets of items. Although it is well known that it is meant for continuous observed indica- tors, it is often used with dichotomous, ordinal, and other types of discrete variables, yielding results that might be incorrect. Not only parameter es- timates may be biased, but also goodness-of-fit indices cannot be trusted. Magidson and Vermunt (2001) presented a nonlinear factor-analytic model based on latent class (LC) analysis that is especially suited for dealing with categorical indicators, such as dichotomous, ordinal, and nominal variables,and counts. The approach is called latent class factor analysis (LCFA) be- cause it combines elements from LC and traditional FA. This LCFA model is one of the LC models implemented in the Latent GOLD program (Vermunt \& Magidson, 2000, 2003). A disadvantage of the LCFA model is, however, that its parameters may be somewhat more difficult to interpret than the typical factor-analytic co- efficients -- factor loadings , factor-item correlations, factor correlations, and communalities . In order to overcome this problem, we propose using a linear approximation of the maximum likelihood estimates obtained with a LCFA model. This makes it possible to provide the same type of output measures as in standard FA, while retaining the fact that the underlying factor structure is identified by the more reliable nonlinear factor-analytic model.},

  abstract = {In problem solving, as in street fighting, rules are for fools: do whatever works---don't just stand there! Yet we often fear an unjustified leap even though it may land us on a correct result. Traditional mathematics teaching is largely about solving exactly stated problems exactly, yet life often hands us partly defined problems needing only moderately accurate solutions. This engaging book is an antidote to the rigor mortis brought on by too much mathematical rigor, teaching us how to guess answers without needing a proof or an exact calculation. In Street-Fighting Mathematics, Sanjoy Mahajan builds, sharpens, and demonstrates tools for educated guessing and down-and-dirty, opportunistic problem solving across diverse fields of knowledge---from mathematics to management. Mahajan describes six tools: dimensional analysis, easy cases, lumping, picture proofs, successive approximation, and reasoning by analogy. Illustrating each tool with numerous examples, he carefully separates the tool---the general principle---from the particular application so that the reader can most easily grasp the tool itself to use on problems of particular interest. Street-Fighting Mathematics grew out of a short course taught by the author at MIT for students ranging from first-year undergraduates to graduate students ready for careers in physics, mathematics, management, electrical engineering, computer science, and biology. They benefited from an approach that avoided rigor and taught them how to use mathematics to solve real problems.

About the Author Sanjoy Mahajan studied mathematics at the University of Oxford and received a PhD in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.

  abstract = {In this book, Sanjoy Mahajan shows us that the way to master complexity is through insight rather than precision. Precision can overwhelm us with information, whereas insight connects seemingly disparate pieces of information into a simple picture. Unlike computers, humans depend on insight. Based on the author's fifteen years of teaching at MIT, Cambridge University, and Olin College, The Art of Insight in Science and Engineering shows us how to build insight and find understanding, giving readers tools to help them solve any problem in science and engineering. To master complexity, we can organize it or discard it. The Art of Insight in Science and Engineering first teaches the tools for organizing complexity, then distinguishes the two paths for discarding complexity: with and without loss of information. Questions and problems throughout the text help readers master and apply these groups of tools. Armed with this three-part toolchest, and without complicated mathematics, readers can estimate the flight range of birds and planes and the strength of chemical bonds, understand the physics of pianos and xylophones, and explain why skies are blue and sunsets are red.

  abstract = {1. Recent technical and methodological advances have led to a dramatic increase in the use of spectrometry to quantify reflectance properties of biological materials, as well asmodels to determine how these colours are per- ceived by animals, providing important insights into ecological and evolutionary aspects of animal visual com- munication. 2. Despite this growing interest, a unified cross-platform framework for analysing and visualizing spectral data has not been available. We introduce pavo, an R package that facilitates the organization, visualization and analysis of spectral data in a cohesive framework. pavo is highly flexible, allowing users to (a) organize and manipulate data from a variety of sources, (b) visualize data using R's state-of-the-art graphics capabilities and (c) analyse data using spectral curve shape properties and visual systemmodelling for a broad range of taxa. 3. In this paper, we present a summary of the functions implemented in pavo and how they integrate in a work- flow to explore and analyse spectral data.We also present an exact solution for the calculation of colour volume overlap in colourspace, thus expanding previously publishedmethodologies. 4. As an example of pavo's capabilities, we compare the colour patterns of three African glossy starling species, two of which have diverged very recently. We demonstrate how both colour vision models and direct spectral measurement analysis can be used to describe colour attributes and differences between these species. Different approaches to visual models and several plotting capabilities exemplify the package's versatility and streamlined workflow. 5. pavo provides a cohesive environment for handling spectral data and addressing complex sensory ecology questions, while integratingwithR's modular core for a broader and comprehensive analytical framework, automated management of spectral data and reproducibleworkflows for colour analysis.},

  abstract = {Ein geringes Wirtschaftswachstum, hohe Arbeitslosenzahlen sowie eine hohe Staatsverschuldung prägen zunehmend die Situation in den europäischen Industrienationen. Öffentliche und private Organisationen in den einzelnen Ländern sind dabei mit dem wachsenden internationalen Wettbewerb und den steigenden Ansprüchen der Kunden konfrontiert. In dieser Wettbewerbssituation verlieren die meisten Industrienationen täglich Arbeitsplätze, und zwar einfache wie komplexe, an so genannte Niedriglohnländer, wie z.B. die osteuropäischen Staaten, aber auch Indien, China etc. In Deutschland wanderten beispielsweise allein im Jahr 2003 pro Tag 1700 Arbeitsplätze in diese Länder ab. Insgesamt hat dies in Deutschland im Zeitraum von 1991 bis 2004 zu einem Verlust von nahezu zwei Millionen industriellen Arbeitsplätzen geführt. Dabei haben die Reduzierung von Personal und die Optimierung organisationsinterner Prozesse in den 90er Jahren des letzten Jahrhunderts oft nicht den gewünschten wirtschaftlichen Erfolg erzielt (Hamel \& Prahalad, 1994). Im Allgemeinen soll die Bewältigung dieser Herausforderungen durch neue oder optimierte Produkte erfolgen, die schneller auf den Markt gebracht werden, insgesamt sollen neue Märkte eröffnet und die Kundenbedürfnisse noch besser befriedigt werden. Dabei sollen die Kosten der Produkte durch die kontinuierliche Optimierung der Entwicklung, Produktion und des Vertriebs immer weiter abnehmen. Aus wirtschaftlicher Sicht können deshalb Innovationen lang anhaltende Vorteile im nationalen und internationalen Wettbewerb schaffen und für schnelles Wachstum verbunden mit hohen Gewinnen bei den jeweiligen Innovatoren sorgen. Die Kunden nehmen diese Entwicklung durch den starken Preisverfall bei gleichzeitiger Verbesserung der Produktqualität wahr. So kosteten die ersten kommerziellen Mikrowellenherde -- ursprünglich ein Produkt militärischer Radarforschung -- im Jahre 1947 noch stolze 5000 US-Dollar. Sie hatten eine Höhe von 1,55 m, ein Gewicht von 350 kg und sie mussten mit Wasser gekühlt werden. Heutzutage sind sie ab 50 Euro und in Größen erhältlich, die in jede Küche integriert werden können.

Subjects Studies conducted worldwide and published between 1966 and 1998. Main outcome measures Quality of evidence about patient satisfaction. Results 32 studies were identified. Study methods used were simple survey instruments (26 studies), exact methods not specified (5), and qualitative methods (1). Study designs were randomised controlled trial (1 trial); random patient selection (2); case-control (1); and selection criteria not specified or participants represented consecutive referrals, convenience samples, or volunteers (28). Sample sizes were ≤ 20 (10 trials), ≤ 100 (14), {$>$}100 (7), and not specified (1). All studies reported good levels of patient satisfaction. Qualitative analysis revealed methodological problems with all the published work. Even so, important issues were highlighted that merit further investigation. There is a paucity of data examining patients' perceptions or the effects of this mode of healthcare delivery on the interaction between providers and clients. Conclusions Methodological deficiencies (low sample sizes, context, and study designs) of the published research limit the generalisability of the findings. The studies suggest that teleconsultation is acceptable to patients in a variety of circumstances, but issues relating to patient satisfaction require further exploration from the perspective of both clients and providers.},

  abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) methods have been proposed in the academic literature as alternatives to statistical ones for time series forecasting. Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.},

Mindfulness and cognitive emotion regulation can be considered as key factors in getting awareness about one’s weakness and ability to improve it. Therefore, the present research aimed to explore the relationship between mindfulness and anxiety among students. Further, moderating role of adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation(ER) strategy was investigated in the relationship between mindfulness and anxiety. A convenient sample of 210 students including both male (104) and female (106) age ranged between 18 to 26~years was drawn from various universities. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ), and Cognitive Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) were used to measure the variables under study. Correlational analysis indicated a negative relationship of mindfulness with anxiety and adaptive CER strategy whereas anxiety has a positive relationship with maladaptive CER. Furthermore, interactive effect showed moderating role of adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in relation with mindfulness and anxiety. Results revealed that maladaptive CER are considered as contributing factors as they lead to higher level of anxiety when combine with low level of mindfulness. Moreover, it was also suggestive fact that less use of adaptive CER strengthens the negative relationship between mindfulness and anxiety leading towards anxiety symptoms. Implications and suggestions have also been discussed.},

  abstract = {The scientific interest in meditation and mindfulness practice has recently seen an unprecedented surge. After an initial phase of presenting beneficial effects of mindfulness practice in various domains, research is now seeking to unravel the underlying psychological and neurophysiological mechanisms. Advances in understanding these processes are required for improving and fine-tuning mindfulness-based interventions that target specific conditions such as eating disorders or attention deficit hyperactivity disorders. This review presents a theoretical framework that emphasizes the central role of attentional control mechanisms in the development of mindfulness skills. It discusses the phenomenological level of experience during meditation, the different attentional functions that are involved, and relates these to the brain networks that subserve these functions. On the basis of currently available empirical evidence specific processes as to how attention exerts its positive influence are considered and it is concluded that meditation practice appears to positively impact attentional functions by improving resource allocation processes. As a result, attentional resources are allocated more fully during early processing phases which subsequently enhance further processing. Neural changes resulting from a pure form of mindfulness practice that is central to most mindfulness programs are considered from the perspective that they constitute a useful reference point for future research. Furthermore, possible interrelations between the improvement of attentional control and emotion regulation skills are discussed.},

  abstract = {Impulsivity is generally held to be an important dimension of personality. It has been conceptualized in many different ways: as a cognitive style termed impulsivity/reflection, as a subtrait of extraversion or psychoticism, and as a trait of its own. The present study focused on the relation between some of these different impulsivity aspects and response latencies to questionnaires. The Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT), the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI), a self-report impulsivity questionnaire, and the Self-Consciousness Scale (SCS) were administered to 65 Austrian undergraduate students. By means of a computerized presentation, questionnaire response latencies were recorded. Virtually no relationship was found between MFFT, self-report impulsivity, and response latencies. In addition to previous studies, the present results, therefore, cast doubt on a broad impulsivity concept. Secondary findings of this study are pertinent to the relation between impulsivity and anxiety, to the orthogonality of impulsivity and self-consciousness, and to sex differences in impulsivity.},

It has been claimed that companies need to keep track of only their individual NPSs and this one number would determine customer loyalty and the growth rate of the companies. Several academicians and researchers have argued about the validity of NPS as the only factor that determines the company growth rates. The analysis of NPS can be done from both empirical perspective and conceptual perspective. An analysis of NPS from the conceptual perspective based on Reichheld's original paper has been attempted. It is evident from the analysis that NPS only gives a particular direction to increase the company growth rate and is not the only factor that determines it. Several other factors might be there that influence the company growth rate.},

Even though social perception is multi-dimensional, available scales do not adequately picture this complexity in the perception of robots. To develop a new scale, we aggregated data on social perception of robots, initially operationalized as competence, sociability, morality, and anthropomorphism from four prior studies. An exploratory factor analysis on a random sample revealed three factors: “anthropomorphism”, “morality/sociability”, and “activity/cooperation”. To validate these results, we performed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the remaining sample and tested for validity and reliability. Reliability was appropriate. We found significant correlations between age, gender, educational level, and factors of the scale. However, missing values interfered with confirmatory and validating analyses. Despite these issues, the scale  contributes to future research on social perception of robots.},

  abstract = {Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) was developed to combine methods from cognitive behavioral therapy and meditative techniques, with the specific goal of preventing relapse in recurrent depression. While supported by empirical evidence from multiple clinical trials, the cognitive mechanisms behind the effectiveness of MBCT are not well understood in computational (information processing) or biological terms.This article introduces a testable theory about the computational mechanisms behind MBCT that is grounded in “Bayesian brain” concepts of perception from cognitive neuroscience, such as predictive coding. These concepts regard the brain as embodying a model of its environment (including the external world and the body) which predicts future sensory inputs and is updated by prediction errors, depending on how precise these error signals are.This article offers a concrete proposal how core concepts of MBCT—(i) the being mode (accepting whatever sensations arise, without judging or changing them), (ii) decentering (experiencing thoughts and percepts simply as events in the mind that arise and pass), and (iii) cognitive reactivity (changes in mood reactivate negative beliefs)—could be understood in terms of perceptual and metacognitive processes that draw on specific computational mechanisms of the “Bayesian brain.” Importantly, the proposed theory can be tested experimentally, using a combination of behavioral paradigms, computational modelling, and neuroimaging. The novel theoretical perspective on MBCT described in this paper may offer opportunities for finessing the conceptual and practical aspects of MBCT.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND While DSM-5 classified pathological gambling as an addictive disorder, there is debate as to whether ICD-11 should follow suit. The debate hinges on scientific evidence such as neurobiological findings, family history of psychiatric disorders, psychiatric comorbidity, and personality variables. METHODS In the "Baden-Württemberg Study of Pathological Gambling", we compared a group of 515 male pathological gamblers receiving treatment with 269 matched healthy controls. We studied differences in sociodemographic characteristics, gambling-related variables, psychiatric comorbidity (lifetime), family history of psychiatric conditions, as well as personality traits such as impulsivity (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale), sensation seeking (Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale) and the NEO-FFI big five. Personality traits were validated in an age- and ethnicity-matched subsample of "pure" gamblers without any psychiatric comorbidity (including nicotine dependence). Data were analyzed using two-sample t-tests, Chi(2) analyses, Fisher's exact test and Pearson correlation analysis, as appropriate. Bonferroni correction was applied to correct for multiple comparisons. RESULTS Only 1\% of the gamblers had been diagnosed with an impulse control disorder other than gambling (ICD-10). Notably, 88\% of the gamblers in our sample had a comorbid diagnosis of substance dependence. The highest axis I comorbidity rate was for nicotine dependence (80\%), followed by alcohol dependence (28\%). Early age of first gambling experience was correlated with gambling severity. Compared to first-degree relatives of controls, first-degree relatives of pathological gamblers were more likely to suffer from alcohol dependence (27.0\% vs. 7.4\%), pathological gambling (8.3\% vs. 0.7\%) and suicide attempts (2.7\% vs. 0.4\%). Significant group differences were observed for the NEO-FFI factors neuroticism, agreeableness and conscientiousness. Gamblers were also more impulsive than controls, but did not differ from controls in terms of sensation seeking. CONCLUSIONS Our findings support classifying pathological gambling as a behavioural addiction in the ICD-11. This decision will have a significant impact on the approaches available for prevention (e.g. age limits) and treatment.},

However, existing guidelines vary and may be biased by conflicts of interests. Unbiased recommendations can be achieved only if sufficient detail is provided on the composition and representativeness of author groups, methodological rigor, handling of potential conflicts of interest and financing. This paper presents the first evidence-based guidelines for AUD from German-speaking countries. These guidelines are based on the work of delegates from a representative sample of 46 scientific societies (mostly medical) from Austria, Germany and Switzerland dealing with AUD. It also included patients and relatives. Recommendations were derived from a standardised hierarchical process involving quality controls drawn from existing guidelines, de novo literature searches and/or expert experience. Potential conflicts of interest were assessed yearly and led to exclusion from voting in specific areas. An overall cost of more than 400,000€ (for alcohol and tobacco guidelines) were exclusively covered by the participating societies and academic institutions. More than 100 recommendations on screening, diagnostics and treatment of AUD are outlined in this paper, and their scientific background is given in the online supplementary material. Tables of aggregated study synopses (in English) and the full version of guidelines (in German) are available (see "Links").},

  abstract = {Local independence in the Rasch model can be violated in two generic ways that are generally not distinguished clearly in the literature. In this paper we distinguish between a violation of unidimensionality, which we call trait dependence, and a specific violation of statistical independence, which we call response dependence, both of which violate local independence. Distinct algebraic formulations for trait and response dependence are developed as violations of the dichotomous Rasch model, data are simulated with varying degrees of dependence according to these formulations, and then analysed according to the Rasch model assuming no violations. Relative to the case of no violation it is shown that trait and response dependence result in opposite effects on the unit of scale as manifested in the range and standard deviation of the scale and the standard deviation of person locations. In the case of trait dependence the scale is reduced; in the case of response dependence it is increased. Again, relative to the case of no violation, the two violations also have opposite effects on the person separation index (analogous to Cronbach's alpha reliability index of traditional test theory in value and construction): it decreases for data with trait dependence; it increases for data with response dependence. A standard way of accounting for dependence is to combine the dependent items into a higher-order polytomous item. This typically results in a decreased person separation index index and Cronbach's alpha, compared with analysing items as discrete, independent items. This occurs irrespective of the kind of dependence in the data, and so further contributes to the two violations not being distinguished clearly. In an attempt to begin to distinguish between them statistically this paper articulates the opposite effects of these two violations in the dichotomous Rasch model.},

  abstract = {Despite the large potential role that community nurses have in providing individualized health promotion to older people, there is a lack of consensus in the literature regarding this role's effectiveness and efficiency. This article presents a literature review and synthesis of 12 randomized controlled trials selected from 344 published studies on preventive home visitation programs for older people. The findings suggest that a diversity of home visiting interventions carried out by nurses can favorably affect health and functional status, mortality rates, use of hospitalization and nursing homes, and costs. Further research is needed that focuses on the outcomes of quality of life, mental health, social support, caregiver burden, the acceptability of intervention, and specific subgroups of clients who benefit most. Findings also indicate the need for a theoretical foundation, increased emphasis on health-promotion strategies, and more research using a more complete economic evaluation to establish efficiency.

  abstract = {For the first time in history, it is possible to study human behavior on great scale and in fine detail simultaneously. Online services and ubiquitous computational devices, such as smartphones and modern cars, record our everyday activity. The resulting Big Data offers unprecedented opportunities for tracking and analyzing behavior. This paper hypothesizes the applicability and impact of Big Data technologies in the context of psychometrics both for research and clinical applications. It first outlines the state of the art, including the severe shortcomings with respect to quality and quantity of the resulting data. It then presents a technological vision, comprised of (i) numerous data sources such as mobile devices and sensors, (ii) a central data store, and (iii) an analytical platform, employing techniques from data mining and machine learning. To further illustrate the dramatic benefits of the proposed methodologies, the paper then outlines two current projects, logging and analyzing smartphone usage. One such study attempts to thereby quantify severity of major depression dynamically; the other investigates (mobile) Internet Addiction. Finally, the paper addresses some of the ethical issues inherent to Big Data technologies. In summary, the proposed approach is about to induce the single biggest methodological shift since the beginning of psychology or psychiatry. The resulting range of applications will dramatically shape the daily routines of researches and medical practitioners alike. Indeed, transferring techniques from computer science to psychiatry and psychology is about to establish Psycho-Informatics, an entire research direction of its own. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Background Dementia and cognitive impairment associated with aging are a major medical and social concern. Neuropsychological testing is a key element in the diagnostic procedures of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), but has presently a limited value in the prediction of progression to dementia. We advance the hypothesis that newer statistical classification methods derived from data mining and machine learning methods like Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and Random Forests can improve accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of predictions obtained from neuropsychological testing. Seven non parametric classifiers derived from data mining methods (Multilayer Perceptrons Neural Networks, Radial Basis Function Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, CART, CHAID and QUEST Classification Trees and Random Forests) were compared to three traditional classifiers (Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression) in terms of overall classification accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, Area under the ROC curve and Press'Q. Model predictors were 10 neuropsychological tests currently used in the diagnosis of dementia. Statistical distributions of classification parameters obtained from a 5-fold cross-validation were compared using the Friedman's nonparametric test. Results Press' Q test showed that all classifiers performed better than chance alone (p {$<$} 0.05). Support Vector Machines showed the larger overall classification accuracy (Median (Me) = 0.76) an area under the ROC (Me = 0.90). However this method showed high specificity (Me = 1.0) but low sensitivity (Me = 0.3). Random Forest ranked second in overall accuracy (Me = 0.73) with high area under the ROC (Me = 0.73) specificity (Me = 0.73) and sensitivity (Me = 0.64). Linear Discriminant Analysis also showed acceptable overall accuracy (Me = 0.66), with acceptable area under the ROC (Me = 0.72) specificity (Me = 0.66) and sensitivity (Me = 0.64). The remaining classifiers showed overall classification accuracy above a median value of 0.63, but for most sensitivity was around or even lower than a median value of 0.5. Conclusions When taking into account sensitivity, specificity and overall classification accuracy Random Forests and Linear Discriminant analysis rank first among all the classifiers tested in prediction of dementia using several neuropsychological tests. These methods may be used to improve accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of Dementia predictions from neuropsychological testing.},

Mindfulness meditation is thought to be beneficial in the management of various physical and mental health conditions. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation practice as a healthcare intervention. Methods: Systematic computerised and hand literature searches for randomised controlled trials and evaluation using methodological quality criteria. Results: The higher quality studies analysed in this review have demonstrated replicated statistically significant improvements in spirituality and positive health measures and decreases in depressive relapse, depressive recurrence and psychological distress. Conclusions: Despite the lack of specific, reliable and validated mindfulness measures, mindfulness shows potential as a positive healthcare intervention and continued investigation is warranted. Further research using improved methodology and utilising specific mindfulness outcome measures in trials with long-term follow up, larger populations and a wider demographic range is recommended. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The manual decomposition of source concepts according to the ICNP 7-Axis Model served to validate the mappings. A total of 62\% of the CCC Nursing Diagnoses were a pre-coordinated match to an ICNP concept, 35\% were a post-coordinated match and only 3\% had no match.

  abstract = {While much attention has been devoted to examining the beneficial effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction programs on patients' ability to cope with various chronic medical conditions, most studies have relied on self-report measures of improvement. Given that these measures may not accurately reflect physiological conditions, there is a need for an objective marker of improvement in research evaluating the beneficial effects of stress management programs. Cortisol is the major stress hormone in the human organism and as such is a promising candidate measure in the study of the effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction programs. In conjunction with other biological measures, the use of cortisol levels as a physiological marker of stress may be useful to validate self-reported benefits attributed to this program. In the current manuscript, we review the available literature on the role of cortisol as a physiological marker for improvement with regards to mindfulness practice, and make recommendations for future study designs. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Background Changes in the cortisol awakening response (CAR) were studied in women participating in a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program after completion of their medical treatment for breast cancer.Method Thirty-three women completed questionnaires pre- and post-MBSR pertaining to: stress, depressive symptomatology, and medical symptoms. The CAR was assessed on 3 days pre- and 3 days post-MBSR as a biological marker of stress.Results A significant effect on the CAR was found, with cortisol levels showing a prolonged increase after awakening at the post-MBSR assessment period. This was accompanied by significant improvements in self-reported stress levels, depressive symptomatology, and medical symptoms. Furthermore, the change in medical symptoms was negatively correlated with the area under the curve (AUC) at study onset (r = -.52, p {$<$} .002); i.e., the greater the AUC of the CAR before MBSR, the greater the reduction in medical symptoms after the program.Conclusions These results suggest the potential usefulness of employing the CAR as a biological marker in women with breast cancer participating in an MBSR program.},

  abstract = {Diagnostische Zielsetzung:Bei den Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) handelt es sich um ein haeufig eingesetztes und bewaehrtes Verfahren zur Messung des sprachunabhaengigen logischen Denkens. Die APM gehoeren zur Verfahrensgruppe der Raven-Matrizen-Tests (RPM) und stellen in diesem Rahmen eine Version fuer ein ueberdurchschnittliches kognitives Leistungsniveau dar. Durch den Einsatz eines Zeitlimits kann die intellektuelle Effizienz der Probanden beurteilt werden.Aufbau:Die APM-Items bestehen aus geometrischen Figuren bzw. Mustern, in denen je ein Element ausgelassen wurde. Aus acht Antwortalternativen ist diejenige zu waehlen, die das Muster korrekt ergaenzt. Die Aufgaben sind nach Schwierigkeitsgrad geordnet und in zwei separaten Aufgabenheften zu den Aufgabensets 1 und 2 zusammengefasst. Das erste Set umfasst 12 Aufgaben (APM I), das zweite 36 Aufgaben (APM II). APM I wird entweder zur Vorbereitung des Einsatzes von APM II oder als Screeninginstrument eingesetzt. APM II ist lediglich bei Personen mit hinreichend hohem intellektuellen Leistungsniveau einzusetzen, um unnoetige Frustrationen zu vermeiden. Die gewaehlte Antwortalternative ist auf einem Durchschreibebogen bzw. in der computerisierten Version auf dem Monitor anzukreuzen.Grundlagen und Konstruktion:Die APM wurden 1943 zur Personalauslese im militaerischen Bereich eingesetzt und 1947 fuer den allgemeinen Gebrauch veroeffentlicht. Basierend auf Analysen der Aufgabenschwierigkeit wurden die Items nach ansteigender Schwierigkeit geordnet. Eine erste Revision der APM und eine Reduktion der urspruenglich 48 Items auf 36 Items (APM II) erfolgten 1962. In den aktuellen Auflagen des Verfahrens wurden die Items und ihre Reihenfolge nicht mehr modifiziert. Die mit den RPM gemessene Faehigkeit, Beziehungen zu stiften, wird von Raven als Faehigkeit beschrieben, aus vorgegebenen Informationen ein neues Verstaendnis bzw. neue Informationen abzuleiten.Empirische Prüfung und Gütekriterien:Aktuelle Manuale fuer die APM liegen von Raven et al. (1998b) sowie Heller et al. (1998) vor. Beide Manuale zitieren zahlreiche Studien, die mit den APM und den RPM als Verfahrensgruppe durchgefuehrt worden sind.Reliabilität: Die Reliabilitaetskoeffizienten fuer APM I fallen deutlich niedriger aus als fuer APM II. Als Masse der internen Konsistenz ermittelten Raven et al. (1998b, S. 24) fuer die APM II Split-half-Reliabilitaetskoeffizienten zwischen .83 und .87, fuer APM I Werte um .73. Heller et al. (1998, S. 12) ermittelten Alphawerte zwischen .34 und .78 (APM I) sowie zwischen .70 und .88 (APM II; Schueler der Klassen 6 bis 12). Nach einem Intervall von 3 Monaten ermittelten Heller et al. (1998, S. 13) an Schuelerstichproben Retestreliabilitaetskoeffizienten zwischen .58 und .82.Validität: Verwiesen wird auf signifikante Korrelationen zwischen APM und anderen Verfahren zur Messung intellektueller Faehigkeiten. Die Korrelationen mit sprachfreien Verfahren (z.B. Wechsler-Handlungs-IQ: r = .55) liegen ueber denen mit sprachbezogenen Verfahren (z.B. Wechsler-Verbal-IQ: r = .42; 131 Schueler). Korrelationen zwischen APM und den quantitativen und nonverbalen Skalen des Kognitiven Faehigkeitstests (.26 bis .44) bestaetigen insbesondere die Komponente des analogen Denkens in den APM (98 hochbegabte Schueler der 9./10. Klasse Gymnasium; 59 Schueler der 10. Klasse Regelgymnasium). Mit der beim Zahlenverbindungstest zentralen Komponente der Informationsverarbeitungsgeschwindigkeit weisen die APM zwar signifikante, aber nicht sehr hohe Zusammenhaenge von .34 (APM I) bzw. .33 (APM II) auf (114 Schueler der 8./9. Klasse). Mit den Mathematikschulnoten der 8. bzw. 9. Klasse (223 Schueler) bzw. den Deutschnoten wiesen die APM Korrelationen in Hoehe von .34 (APM I) und .35(APM II) bzw. .23 (APM I) und .27 (APM II) auf. Hinweise auf eine Geschlechtsabhaengigkeit der APM-Ergebnisse liegen nicht vor.Normen: Die deutschen Referenzwerte (Prozentraenge) von Raven et al. (1998b) basieren auf einer Stichprobe von 1142 Personen (48.5\% weiblich, 51,5\% maennlich; 13-75 Jahre). Ein vorhandenes Zeitlimit sowie unterschiedliche Bildungsniveaus und Berufsgruppen werden beruecksichtigt. Die Normen der APM-Ausgabe von Heller et al. (1998) beruhen auf einer deutschsprachigen Stichprobe von 581 Studierenden, 921 Schuelern und 157 Senioren ueber 60 Jahren. Ferner werden Daten von Normierungsstichproben aus Australien, China, Deutschland, Grossbritannien, Neuseeland, Nordirland, Polen sowie den USA aufgefuehrt.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although patient safety climate is an important factor in preventing adverse events in health care organizations, there is no usable Japanese scale. OBJECTIVE: To develop a Japanese scale to measure patient safety climate and to evaluate its psychometric properties. METHODS: Cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted with respect to 9 non-academic general hospitals in Japan. A total of 1878 health care professionals (nurses, therapists, technicians, pharmacists and physicians) were included in a study. RESULTS: The eight dimensions measuring worker attitudes (free communication flow, continuous improvement, reporting/rules compliance and patient/family involvement) and organizational factors (supervisors' safety leadership, allied professionals' safety leadership, patient safety committee leadership and rules/equipment availability) were extracted by factor analysis. The internal consistency (measured by Cronbach's alpha) and repeatability (measured by intraclass correlation) were more than 0.70 for all subscales. In addition, the mean score, the within-group interrater reliability statistic (r(wg)) and the correlation coefficients of the mean score were confirmed at the workplace level. CONCLUSIONS: The scale showed acceptable dimensionality, reliability and validity. It also provided workplace team-evaluation and a tool for assessing the patient safety climate at the level of the workplace.},

Whole-brain functional imaging was performed on a 1.5-T MRI scanner using a spiral pulse sequence while the subjects performed a visually paced ``button-press��? motor task with their dominant right hand alternating with a rest state.Results: Although the groups did not differ in accuracy, there was an increase in reaction time in the elderly subjects (mean score \$±\$ SD, young subjects = 547 \$±\$ 97 ms, elderly subjects = 794 \$±\$ 280 ms, p {$<$} 0.03). There was a greater extent of activation in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, lateral premotor area, supplementary motor area, and ipsilateral cerebellum in the elderly subjects relative to the young subjects (p {$<$} 0.001). Additional areas of activation, absent in the young subjects, were seen in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex, putamen (left {$>$} right), and contralateral cerebellum of the elderly subjects.Conclusions: The results of this study show that elderly subjects recruit additional cortical and subcortical areas even for the performance of a simple motor task. These changes may represent compensatory mechanisms invoked by the aging brain, such as reorganization and redistribution of functional networks to compensate for age-related structural and neurochemical changes.}

As such, a large portion of most introductory statistics courses is focused on teaching the fundamentals of statistical inference. The goal of this study is to make a formal comparison of learning outcomes under the traditional and simulation-based inference curricula. A randomized experiment was conducted to administer the two curricula to students in an introductory statistics course. Students of the simulation-based curriculum were found to have improved learning outcomes on topics in statistical inference; however, a clear violation of between-student independence due to group administration of curriculum treatments casts considerable doubt on the statistical significance of these results. A simulation study is used to demonstrate the volatility of Type I error rates in educational studies where classroom level covariance structures exist by comparisons are made on the student level.},

A portion of the respondents were randomly pre-assigned to a condition that induced mindfulness. On 19 of the 22 biases, those induced to be mindful were less likely to show the bias. They also scored higher on 11 of the 14 LMS questions. The method by which we induced mindfulness was unrelated to the context of the later questions, involving image comparisons and standard Langerian instructions to notice three new things. People can boost their decision-making abilities merely by increasing their mindfulness, with no need for meditation, psychological training, or statistical education.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the current knowledge of the neurophysiology and cellular pharmacology of sleep mechanisms. It is written from the perspective that recent years have seen a remarkable development of knowledge about sleep mechanisms, due to the capability of current cellular neurophysiological, pharmacological and molecular techniques to provide focused, detailed, and replicable studies that have enriched and informed the knowledge of sleep phenomenology and pathology derived from electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis. This chapter has a cellular and neurophysiological/neuropharmacological focus, with an emphasis on rapid eye movement (REM) sleep mechanisms and non-REM (NREM) sleep phenomena attributable to adenosine. The survey of neuronal and neurotransmitter-related brainstem mechanisms of REM includes monoamines, acetylcholine, the reticular formation, a new emphasis on GABAergic mechanisms and a discussion of the role of orexin/hypcretin in diurnal consolidation of REM sleep. The focus of the NREM sleep discussion is on the basal forebrain and adenosine as a mediator of homeostatic control. Control is through basal forebrain extracellular adenosine accumulation during wakefulness and inhibition of wakefulness-active neurons. Over longer periods of sleep loss, there is a second mechanism of homeostatic control through transcriptional modification. Adenosine acting at the A1 receptor produces an up-regulation of A1 receptors, which increases inhibition for a given level of adenosine, effectively increasing the gain of the sleep homeostat. This second mechanism likely occurs in widespread cortical areas as well as in the basal forebrain. Finally, the results of a new series of experimental paradigms in rodents to measure the neurocognitive effects of sleep loss and sleep interruption (modeling sleep apnea) provide animal model data congruent with those in humans.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial, OBJECTIVES: To compare changes in shoulder internal rotation range of motion (ROM), for 2 stretching exercises, the "cross-body stretch" and the "sleeper stretch," in individuals with posterior shoulder tightness. BACKGROUND: Recently, some authors have expressed the belief that the sleeper stretch is better than the cross-body stretch to address glenohumeral posterior tightness because the scapula is stabilized. METHODS: Fifty-four asymptomatic subjects (20 males, 34 females) participated in the study. The control group (n=24) consisted of subjects with a between-shoulder difference in internal rotation ROM of less than 10 degrees, whereas those subjects with more than a 10 degrees difference were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 intervention groups, the sleeper stretch group (n=15) or the cross-body stretch group (n=15). Shoulder internal rotation ROM, with the arm abducted to 90 degrees and scapula motion prevented, was measured before and after a 4-week intervention period. Subjects in the control group were asked not to engage in any new stretching activities, while subjects in the 2 stretching groups were asked to perform stretching exercises on the more limited side only, once daily for 5 repetitions, holding each stretch for 30 seconds. RESULTS: The improvements in internal rotation ROM for the subjects in the cross-body stretch group (mean +/- SD, 20.0 degrees +/- 12.9 degrees) were significantly greater than for the subjects in the control group (5.9 degrees +/- 9.4 degrees, P = .009). The gains in the sleeper stretch group (12.4 degrees +/- 10.4 degrees) were not significant compared to those of the control group (P = .586) and those of the cross-body stretch group (P = .148). CONCLUSIONS: The cross-body stretch in individuals with limited shoulder internal rotation ROM appears to be more effective than no stretching in controls without internal rotation asymmetry to improve shoulder internal rotation ROM. While the improvement in internal rotation from the cross-body stretch was greater than for the sleeper stretch and of a magnitude that could be clinically significant, the small sample size likely precluded statistical significance between groups.},

Data were provided by 267 men and 201 women ages 19 to 93. Consistent with earlier research and evaluations, there was no support for the view that the MBTI measures truly dichotomous preferences or qualitatively distinct types; instead, the instrument measures four relatively independent dimensions. The interpretation of the Judging-Perceiving index was also called into question. The data suggest that Jung's theory is either incorrect or inadequately operationalized by the MBTI and cannot provide a sound basis for interpreting it. However, correlational analyses showed that the four MBTI indices did measure aspects of four of the five major dimensions of normal personality. The five-factor model provides an alternative basis for interpreting MBTI findings within a broader, more commonly shared conceptual framework.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the development and initial validation of the self-administered Client Perceptions of Coordination Questionnaire. DESIGN: The instrument was developed between 1996 and 1997 through iterative item generation; within a framework of six domains of coordination, addressed across four sectors of health care provision. SETTING: 1193 individuals with complex and chronic health care needs as judged by their general practitioners (GPs), who were participants in a 2-year randomized controlled trial of a coordinated care intervention in Australia. Other samples were collected in one general practice (98) and from attendees of a chronic pain management course (29). MAIN MEASURES: Face and content validity, completion rates, transferability, internal consistency, and construct validity of the 32-item instrument. RESULTS: Most items achieved excellent completion and comprehension rates. The instrument was transferable to another chronically unwell population. Cronbach's alpha of the entire instrument was 0.92, and for six individual scales scores ranged from 0.31 to 0.86. The six scales based on principal components analysis were acceptability, received care, GP, nominated provider, client comprehension, and client capacity. The first four scales were satisfactory, but the client scales were inadequate with poor internal consistency, and convergent and discriminant validity. People with chronic pain syndromes had significantly worse experiences for almost all items, supporting construct validity. CONCLUSION: This instrument is one of the first to attempt to measure coordination of health care. Its strengths include ease of completion, transferability, and promising psychometric properties and construct validity. Problems capturing data about the patient's contribution to coordination highlight a lack of theoretical development in this area. A valid measure of coordination should be useful in needs assessment, program evaluation, and individual provider/practice audit, and would contribute to research into the experience and measurement of patient-focused care.},

Over-selectivity occurs when behavior is controlled by a limited number of stimuli in the environment. Mindfulness is a construct that specifically targets attention and awareness of the present moment. The current study aimed to remediate over-selectivity in an elderly population by means of a focused attention/mindfulness induction. The results of this study indicated that the level of emergent over-selectivity in an elderly population was significantly reduced after a focused attention induction when compared to an unfocused attention induction.

  abstract = {Previous work on the aesthetics of simple figures such as rectangles and triangles, as well as on the aesthetics of color, suggests that although there are clear population level preferences, there are also large individual differences which are temporally stable, and which any adequate theoretical analysis must take into account. Data presented here show similar phenomena in a related problem in composition---where to place an object within the frame of a picture to produce the optimal aesthetic effect. A novel and powerful "method of randomized paired comparisons" first showed that there are overall population level preferences, with objects being placed preferentially at the two golden sections horizontally, and between the two golden sections vertically. As in the studies of simple figures and colors, there are large individual differences. A cognitive model of "sensory aesthetics" is proposed in which continua of any type (space, geometric objects, colors, or whatever), are described categorically, usually in terms of words such as "square," "rectangle," "line," etc., each of which is a fuzzy set. Preference functions are then derived from the union and intersection of the fuzzy set functions, which differ between individuals as their categories differ or as they prefer objects which are prototypical, or are at the boundaries between prototypes. There is therefore wide inter-individual variability.}

This survey paper tackles a comprehensive overview of the last update in this field. Many recently proposed algorithms' enhancements and various SA applications are investigated and presented briefly in this survey. These articles are categorized according to their contributions in the various SA techniques. The related fields to SA (transfer learning, emotion detection, and building resources) that attracted researchers recently are discussed. The main target of this survey is to give nearly full image of SA techniques and the related fields with brief details. The main contributions of this paper include the sophisticated categorizations of a large number of recent articles and the illustration of the recent trend of research in the sentiment analysis and its related areas. © 2014.},

Mental calculation often involves the use of specific techniques devised for specific types of problems.  People with unusually high ability to perform mental calculations are called mental calculators or lightning calculators. Many of these techniques take advantage of or rely on the decimal numeral system. Usually, the choice of radix is what determines which method or methods to use.},

The aim of this study was to present measures of variation appropriate for the logistic case in a didactic rather than a mathematical way. Design and participants: Data were used from the health survey conducted in 2000 in the county of Scania, Sweden, that comprised 10 723 persons aged 18–80 years living in 60 areas. Conducting multilevel logistic regression different techniques were applied to investigate whether the individual propensity to consult private physicians was statistically dependent on the area of residence (that is, intraclass correlation (ICC), median odds ratio (MOR)), the 80\% interval odds ratio (IOR-80), and the sorting out index). Results: The MOR provided more interpretable information than the ICC on the relevance of the residential area for understanding the individual propensity of consulting private physicians. The MOR showed that the unexplained heterogeneity between areas was of greater relevance than the individual variables considered in the analysis (age, sex, and education) for understanding the individual propensity of visiting private physicians. Residing in a high education area increased the probability of visiting a private physician. However, the IOR showed that the unexplained variability between areas did not allow to clearly distinguishing low from high propensity areas with the area educational level. The sorting out index was equal to 82\%. Conclusion: Measures of variation in logistic regression should be promoted in social epidemiological and public health research as efficient means of quantifying the importance of the context of residence for understanding disparities in health and health related behaviour.}

  abstract = {We use a power-to-resist game to find out the effects of individuals' judgments about a proposer's selection procedure on the willingness to offer resistance to proposed outcomes. In the experiment, one individual is selected based on a particular procedure. This individual is allowed to propose how to allocate a pie among five group members: herself and four responders. Then each responder in the group can decide whether to offer costly resistance to the proposed allocation. Resistance is modeled as a threshold public good. If the resistance is successful, the proposer receives nothing. If resistance is unsuccessful, the pie is distributed according to the proposer's decision. We find that resistance increases with (a) the size of the proposal, with (b) subjectively perceived unfairness of the selection procedure for the proposer's role, and with (c) the individual procedural preferences being unsatisfied. Surprisingly, resistance is not affected by whether the group's majority vote on the selection procedure is respected. We check for the robustness of our results and find that the results are stable over two countries. The presented evidence suggests that procedural effects over and above outcomes are relevant in strategic interaction.},

  abstract = {We explored cross-sectionally the roles in bipolar spectrum symptomatology of two broad motivational systems that are thought to control levels of responsiveness to cues of threat and reward, the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) and the Behavioral Activation System (BAS). Undergraduate students (n = 357) completed questionnaires regarding (a) bipolar spectrum disorders [the General Behavior Inventory (GBI), a well-established clinical screening measure], (b) current depression and mania symptoms (the Internal State Scale; ISS), and (c) BIS/BAS sensitivities (the BIS/BAS scales). Validated cutoff scores on the GBI were used to identify individuals at risk for a mood disorder. It was hypothesized that, among at-risk respondents, high BAS and low BIS levels would be associated with high current mania ratings, whereas low BAS and high BIS would be associated with high current depression ratings. Multiple regression analyses indicated that, among at-risk individuals (n = 63), BAS accounted for 27\% of current mania symptoms but BIS did not contribute. For these individuals, BAS and BIS were both significant and together accounted for 44\% of current depressive symptoms.},

  abstract = {An investigation of the distributional characteristics of 440 large-sample achievement and psychometric measures found all to be significantly nonnormal at the alpha .01 significance level. Several classes of contamination were found, including tail weights from the uniform to the double exponential, exponential-level asymmetry, severe digit preferences, multimodalities, and modes external to the mean/median interval. Thus, the underlying tenets of normality-assuming statistics appear fallacious for these commonly used types of data. However, findings here also fail to support the types of distributions used in most prior robustness research suggesting the failure of such statistics under nonnormal conditions. A reevaluation of the statistical robustness literature appears appropriate in light of these findings.}

Three theories are identified: the representational, the operational, and the classical. In each case the relation between measurement scales and statistical procedures is explored. The representational theory implies a relation between measurement scales and statistics, though not the one mentioned by Stevens or his followers. The operational and classical theories, for different reasons, imply no relation between measurement scales and statistics, contradicting Stevens's prescriptions. A resolution of this issue depends on a critical evaluation of these different theories.}

  abstract = {According to the realist interpretation, measurement commits us not just to the logically independent existence of things in space and time, but also to the existence of quantitatively structured properties and relations, and to the existence of real numbers, understood as relations of ratio between specific levels of such attributes. Measurement is defined as the estimation of numerical relations (or ratios) between magnitudes of a quantitative attribute and a unit. The history of scientific measurement, from antiquity to the present may be interpreted as revealing a progressive deepening in the understanding of this position. First, the concept of ratio was broadened to include ratios between incommensurable magnitudes; second, the concept of a quantitative attribute was broadened to include non-extensive quantities; third, quantitative structure and its relations to ratios and real numbers were elaborated; and finally, the issue of empirically distinguishing between quantitative and non-quantitative structures was addressed. This interpretation of measurement understands it in a way that is continuous with scientific investigation in general, i.e., as an attempt to discover independently existing facts. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This inference has been a feature of psychometrics since early last century, before which it permeated scientific thought and played a role in the development of psychophysics. Despite this, its cogency has been analysed only rarely. Elsewhere, I have argued that it is not deductively valid, a point that might be considered obvious except that attempts have been made to show otherwise. Its invalidity displayed, it is easily shown that it is not inductively reasonable either. However, it might still be urged that the inference from order to quantity is an inference to the best explanation: that is, that quantitative structure is reasonably abduced from order. I argue that the opposite is true: the most plausible hypothesis is that the sorts of attributes psychometricians aspire to measure are merely ordinal attributes with impure differences of degree, a feature logically incompatible with quantitative structure. If so, psychometrics is built upon a myth.},

Psychologists think that theorising in the area of psychological testing involves conjuring constructs, which are operationally defined and measured via psychometric tests. However, the ‘construct’ concept is unworkable and laden with confused philosophical baggage accrued under the hegemony of logical empiricism, and its real function in psychology is obscured. Via an analysis of its history and logic, I expose its flawed conception of the relation between theoretical and observable concepts and the way in which it serves the myth of mental measurement. Finally, it is shown how the actual logic of theorising in science, which entails that theories are best inferred from relevant phenomena, not imaginatively constructed, oppugns this myth and promises to coordinate theoretical concepts with the phenomena to be explained.

  abstract = {Stress has been defined in different ways over the years. Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person. The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual. It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation. Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others. Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).View this table:In this windowIn a new window Box 1: The problem of stress Signs of stress can be seen in people\&\#039;s behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches). If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1).1View this table:In this windowIn a new window Box 2 : Signs of stress Figure 1 A model of stress at work.1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations. Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.

  abstract = {First, the span of absolute judgment and the span of immediate memory impose severe limitations on the amount of information that we are able to receive, process, and remember. By organizing the stimulus input simultaneously into several dimensions and successively into a sequence or chunks, we manage to break (or at least stretch) this informational bottleneck. Second, the process of recoding is a very important one in human psychology and deserves much more explicit attention than it has received. In particular, the kind of linguistic recoding that people do seems to me to be the very lifeblood of the thought processes. Recoding procedures are a constant concern to clinicians, social psychologists, linguists, and anthropologists and yet, probably because recoding is less accessible to experimental manipulation than nonsense syllables or T mazes, the traditional experimental psychologist has contributed little or nothing to their analysis. Nevertheless, experimental techniques can be used, methods of recoding can be specified, behavioral indicants can be found. And I anticipate that we will find a very orderly set of relations describing what now seems an uncharted wilderness of individual differences. Third, the concepts and measures provided by the theory of information provide a quantitative way of getting at some of these questions. The theory provides us with a yardstick for calibrating our stimulus materials and for measuring the performance of our subjects. In the interests of communication I have suppressed the technical details of information measurement and have tried to express the ideas in more familiar terms; I hope this paraphrase will not lead you to think they are not useful in research. Informational concepts have already proved valuable in the study of discrimination and of language; they promise a great deal in the study of learning and memory; and it has even been proposed that they can be useful in the study of concept formation. A lot of questions that seemed fruitless twenty or thirty years ago may now be worth another look. In fact, I feel that my story here must stop just as it begins to get really interesting. And finally, what about the magical number seven? What about the seven wonders of the world, the seven seas, the seven deadly sins, the seven daughters of Atlas in the Pleiades, the seven ages of man, the seven levels of hell, the seven primary colors, the seven notes of the musical scale, and the seven days of the week? What about the seven-point rating scale, the seven categories for absolute judgment, the seven objects in the span of attention, and the seven digits in the span of immediate memory? For the present I propose to withhold judgment. Perhaps there is something deep and profound behind all these sevens, something just calling out for us to discover it. But I suspect that it is only a pernicious, Pythagorean coincidence.},

Participants in the study consisted of 481 21-22-year-old men and women who are part of an ongoing longitudinal study. Psychopathy was assessed by the degree of similarity between an individual's NEO-PI-R and an expert-generated FFM psychopathy prototype. The expert-based prototype supported the account of Widiger and Lynam (1998), as did the correlations between the NEO-PI-R Psychopathy Resemblance Index (PRI) and the individual personality dimensions. The PRI was also related in predicted ways to measures of antisocial behavior, drug use, and psychopathology. The results support the contention that psychopathy can be understood as an extreme variant of common dimensions of personality, and underscore the utility of a dimensional model of personality disorders.},

  abstract = {To promote student engagement, professors must actively seek to create the conditions that foster engagement. Chickering and Gamson (1987) suggest that good practices in undergraduate education are ones that: encourage student-faculty contact, develop reciprocity and cooperation among students, encourage active learning, provide students with prompt feedback, emphasize time on task, communicate high expectations and respect diverse talents and ways of knowing. The purpose of the book is to provide the reader with a variety of techniques that can be used to foster student engagement. The techniques include ways to enhance the level of academic challenge, promote active and collaborative learning, increase student-faculty interaction, provide enriching educational experiences, and create supportive learning environments. The book is divided into six sections. The first section describes factors that promote student engagement and the learning outcomes related to student engagement. The second and third sections describe programs that promote student engagement and include programs that can be implemented at the course level, programs that can be offered by a department, programs that provide for community involvement, institution-wide programs, as well as national programs. Instructors can enhance student engagement by encouraging students to become more active participants in their education. Section 4 of the book provides a number of techniques that can be used to promote active participation in the classroom. Several opportunities for student engagement are described in Section 5. The final section of the book describes several innovative approaches on how to assess student engagement. Section 1, Why and How Engagement Matters, contains: (1) Factors that Promote Student Engagement (Corey L. Guenther and Richard L. Miller); and (2) Outcomes Associated with Student Engagement (Richard L. Miller and Jeanne M. Butler).

  abstract = {Active learning is based on self-directed and autonomous teaching methods, whereas passive learning is grounded in instructor taught lectures. An animal physiology course was studied over a two-year period (Year 1, n = 42 students; Year 2, n = 30 students) to determine the effects of student-led seminar (andragogical) and lecture (pedagogical) teaching methods on students' retention of information and performance. For each year of the study, the course was divided into two time periods. The first half was dedicated to instructor-led lectures, followed by a control survey in which the students rated the efficiency of pedagogical learning on a five-point Likert scale from one (strongly disagree) to five (strongly agree). During the second period, students engaged in andragogical learning via peer-led seminars. An experimental survey was then administered to students using the same scale as above to determine students' preferred teaching method. Raw examination scores and survey results from both halves of the course were statistically analyzed by ANOVA with Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test. By the end of the study, student preference for peer-led seminars increased [mean +/- SD: (2.47 +/- 0.94)/(4.03 +/- 1.36), P {$<$} 0.04], and examination scores significantly increased [mean +/- SD: (73.91\% +/- 13.18)/(85.77 +/- 5.22), P {$<$} 0.001]. A majority of students (68.8\%) preferred a method that contained peer-led seminars and instructor-led lectures. These results may indicate that integration of active and passive learning into undergraduate courses may have greater benefit in terms of student preference and performance than either method alone.},

The present research program analyzed the nature of this type of future-oriented self-control and the psychological processes that underlie it. Enduring individual differences in self-control were found as early as the preschool years. Those 4-year-old children who delayed gratification longer in certain laboratory situations developed into more cognitively and socially competent adolescents, achieving higher scholastic performance and coping better with frustration and stress. Experiments in the same research program also identified specific cognitive and attentional processes that allow effective self-regulation early in the course of development. The experimental results, in turn, specified the particular types of preschool delay situations diagnostic for predicting aspects of cognitive and social competence later in life.},

  abstract = {To comprehend the results of a randomized, controlled trial (RCT), readers must understand its design, conduct, analysis, and interpretation. That goal can be achieved only through complete transparency from authors. Despite several decades of educational efforts, the reporting of RCTs needs improvement. Investigators and editors developed the original CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement to help authors improve reporting by using a checklist and flow diagram. The revised CONSORT statement presented in this paper incorporates new evidence and addresses some criticisms of the original statement. The checklist items pertain to the content of the Title, Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. The revised checklist includes 22 items selected because empirical evidence indicates that not reporting the information is associated with biased estimates of treatment effect or because the information is essential to judge the reliability or relevance of the findings. We intended the flow diagram to depict the passage of participants through an RCT. The revised flow diagram depicts information from four stages of trial (enrollment, intervention allocation, follow-up, and analysis). The diagram explicitly includes the number of participants, for each intervention group, that are included in the primary data analysis. Inclusion of these numbers allows the reader to judge whether the authors have performed an intention-to-treat analysis. In sum, the CONSORT statement is intended to improve the reporting of an RCT, enabling readers to understand a trial's conduct and to assess the validity of its results.},

DATA SOURCES: Cochrane systematic reviews and systematic reviews in paper based journals. STUDY SELECTION: 965 systematic reviews (809 Cochrane reviews and 156 paper based reviews) published between 1995 and 2002. DATA SYNTHESIS: The methodological quality of primary studies was assessed in 854 of the 965 systematic reviews (88.5\%). This occurred more often in Cochrane reviews than in paper based reviews (93.9\% v 60.3\%, P {$<$} 0.0001). Overall, only 496 (51.4\%) used the quality assessment in the analysis and interpretation of the results or in their discussion, with no significant differences between Cochrane reviews and paper based reviews (52\% v 49\%, P = 0.58). The tools and methods used for quality assessment varied widely. CONCLUSIONS: Cochrane reviews fared better than systematic reviews published in paper based journals in terms of assessment of methodological quality of primary studies, although they both largely failed to take it into account in the interpretation of results. Methods for assessment of methodological quality by systematic reviews are still in their infancy and there is substantial room for improvement.},

In this paper, we explain our choices for the design requirements and preferred statistical methods for which no evidence is available in the literature or on which the Delphi panel members had substantial discussion. METHODS: The issues described in this paper are a reflection of the Delphi process in which 43 panel members participated. RESULTS: The topics discussed are internal consistency (relevance for reflective and formative models, and distinction with unidimensionality), content validity (judging relevance and comprehensiveness), hypotheses testing as an aspect of construct validity (specificity of hypotheses), criterion validity (relevance for PROs), and responsiveness (concept and relation to validity, and (in) appropriate measures). CONCLUSIONS: We expect that this paper will contribute to a better understanding of the rationale behind the items, thereby enhancing the acceptance and use of the COSMIN checklist.},

  abstract = {Although patients' satisfaction with treatment has gained much attention, conceptual and methodological issues are not sufficiently investigated. Consequently, well-validated satisfaction scales are rare. In order to respond to methodological requirements being associated with the measurement of patient satisfaction, the Munich Patient Satisfaction Scale (MPSS-24) was developed for psychiatric in-patients. The scale was validated on the basis of three independent samples (n=85, n= 161, n=91), and the effects of moderating variables were controlled. In several steps of item selection the initial pool of 133 items was reduced to 24 items, which were subjected to factor analysis. The MPSS-24 demonstrates one major principal component with two minor factors which indicates that doctor-patient communication is the essential source for patient satisfaction. The instrument is of high internal consistency and reliability, and convergent validity is satisfactory.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose. The purpose of this study was to document the prevalence, severity, and progression of knee flexion contractures (KFCs) in a population of institutionalized elderly and to identify relationships between knee extension and other variables. Subjects. The subjects were 112 nursing home residents who exhibited a broad range of ambulation and cognitive function abilities. Methods. Data were collected initially (T1) and after a 10-month period (T2). Results. Only 25\% of the population had extension in the 0- to 5-degree (lacking full extension) range bilaterally at T1 and T2, leaving the majority of subjects with some degree of unilateral KFC. Most of the subjects with a KFC greater than 20 degrees were nonambulatory and had a significantly higher occurrence of resistance to motion than did nonambulators with a KFC of less than 20 degrees. Knee extension measurements did not change in most subjects between T1 and T2. The knees that did show a change in KFC (either an increase or a decrease) had a significantly higher occurrence of resistance to passive motion than did other knees. Compared with the subjects who gained extension, the subjects who lost extension over the study period more frequently had minimal KFC at T1, were ambulatory at T1, showed a regression in ambulation at T2, and developed resistance to motion at T2. Conclusion and Discussion. The data confirmed significant positive correlations between degree of KFC and presence of resistance to passive knee motion, cognitive impairment, impaired ambulation, and presence of knee pain. Physical therapy assessment and intervention may be appropriate in nonambulatory nursing home residents with resistance to passive motion, residents with KFC approaching 20 degrees, and ambulatory residents with minimal KFC who develop resistance and begin to regress in ambulation. Several areas for future study are suggested.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Mindfulness recently attracted growing interest beyond classical therapeutic contexts and has been adopted in preventive labor contexts and occupational health. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a mobile mindfulness training app regarding work and health indicators. METHODS Participants were employees and assigned randomly to the intervention and control groups. 146 employed participants in the intervention group used the mobile application '7mind' for 14 days. Comparisons were made with 160 employed participants from the control group, who were given access to the app after finishing the study (wait-list control). RESULTS After two weeks of use, significant effects of the training were indicated by better results for the intervention group as compared to the control group. Some of the effect sizes can be considered as large: participants in the intervention group improved in measures of mindfulness, work engagement, job satisfaction, emotional exhaustion, emotional intelligence, innovation and creativity, and self-efficacy. CONCLUSION Conventional mindfulness training programs are organized in groups. Our study demonstrates for the first time the effectiveness of a mobile mindfulness training app in the work context. The mobile app offers an easy and flexible access to training mindfulness and improving work and health-related indicators. ZIEL: Das Konzept der Achtsamkeit findet aktuell eine große Beachtung und das nicht allein im therapeutischen Umfeld, sondern auch in präventiven beruflichen Kontexten. Die vorliegende Studie untersucht die Wirksamkeit eines appbasierten Achtsamkeitstrainings in Bezug auf arbeits- und gesundheitsrelevante Indikatoren bei Berufstätigen. METHODIK An der Studie nahmen Berufstätige teil, die randomisiert einer Interventions- und einer Wartegruppe zugeteilt wurden. 146 Berufstätige der Interventionsgruppe nutzten die mobile Applikation 7mind über einen Zeitraum von 14 Tagen. Verglichen wurden sie mit 160 Berufstätigen der Wartegruppe, die nach Abschluss der Studie ebenfalls Zugriff auf die App erhielten. ERGEBNISSE Im Vergleich zur Wartegruppe zeigen sich bei der Interventionsgruppe nach dem 2-wöchigen Training in allen untersuchten Bereichen positive (signifikante) Effekte, z.T. mit großen Effektstärken: Die Nutzer und Nutzerinnen weisen höhere Werte in Bezug auf Achtsamkeit, Arbeitsengagement, Arbeitszufriedenheit, emotionale Intelligenz, Innovation und Kreativität sowie Selbstwirksamkeit und geringere Werte in der emotionalen Erschöpfung auf. SCHLUSSFOLGERUNGEN Klassische Achtsamkeitstrainings werden in Form von Gruppenkursen durchgeführt. Die vorliegende Studie zeigt, dass auch ein appbasiertes Training bei Berufstätigen positive Effekte mit arbeits- und gesundheitsbezogener Relevanz erzielt. Die mobile App bietet damit einen einfachen und flexiblen Einstieg zur Stärkung von Achtsamkeit, auch unter präventiv- und arbeitsmedizinischen Gesichtspunkten.}

The present study introduces a novel source of data: recordings of the actual problem behavior under investigation. A total of N = 58 participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire measuring problematic mobile phone behavior featuring several questions on weekly phone usage. After filling in the questionnaire, all participants received an application to be installed on their smartphones, which recorded their phone usage for five weeks. The analyses revealed that weekly phone usage in hours was overestimated; in contrast, numbers of call and text message related variables were underestimated. Importantly, several associations between actual usage and being addicted to mobile phones could be derived exclusively from the recorded behavior, but not from self-report variables. The study demonstrates the potential benefit to include methods of psychoinformatics in the diagnosis and treatment of problematic mobile phone use.},

  abstract = {The present paper provides insight into an emerging research discipline called Psychoinformatics. In the context of Psychoinformatics, we emphasize the cooperation between the disciplines of psychology and computer science in handling large data sets derived from heavily used devices, such as smartphones or online social network sites, in order to shed light on a large number of psychological traits, including personality and mood. New challenges await psychologists in light of the resulting "Big Data" sets, because classic psychological methods will only in part be able to analyze this data derived from ubiquitous mobile devices, as well as other everyday technologies. As a consequence, psychologists must enrich their scientific methods through the inclusion of methods from informatics. The paper provides a brief review of one area of this research field, dealing mainly with social networks and smartphones. Moreover, we highlight how data derived from Psychoinformatics can be combined in a meaningful way with data from human neuroscience. We close the paper with some observations of areas for future research and problems that require consideration within this new discipline.}

  abstract = {Classical factor analysis relies on the assumption of normally distributed factors that guarantees the model to be estimated via the maximum likelihood method. Even when the assumption of Gaussian factors is not explicitly formulated and estimation is performed via the iterated principal factors' method, the interest is actually mainly focussed on the linear structure of the data, since only moments up to the second ones are involved. In many real situations, the factors could not be adequately described by the first two moments only. For example, skewness characterizing most latent variables in social analysis can be properly measured by the third moment: the factors are not normally distributed and covariance is no longer a sufficient statistic. In this work we propose a factor model characterized by skew-normally distributed factors. Skew-normal refers to a parametric class of probability distributions, that extends the normal distribution by an additional shape parameter regulating the skewness. The model estimation can be solved by the generalized EM algorithm, in which the iterative Newthon-Raphson procedure is needed in the M-step to estimate the factor shape parameter. The proposed skew-normal factor analysis is applied to the study of student satisfaction towards university courses, in order to identify the factors representing different aspects of the latent overall satisfaction.}

  abstract = {This paper presents the results of a prospective study testing an expanded theory of reasoned action (TRA) to predict mammography participation. A questionnaire was developed to measure each of the expanded TRA model components. A sample was identified of 946 women age 40 and above who were invited to obtain a mammogram at the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound Breast Cancer Screening Program (BCSP). The sample was stratified by risk category as determined by the screening program. The study questionnaire was administered to all women in the sample within 2 weeks after they were sent the invitation to obtain a mammogram. Mammography participation was obtained from the BCSP data base 6 months after the invitation. Regression analyses found attitude, affect, subjective norm, and facilitating conditions to all be significantly associated with participation. The expanded TRA model explained 39\% of the variance in women's intentions and 20\% of the variance in participation behavior. A stepwise hierarchical regression found that no other psychosocial measures were able to improve the model predictions of behavior. An interaction between habit and intention was found such that women with larger numbers of previous mammograms were less likely to carry out their intentions than women with fewer previous mammograms. Contrary to expectations, some demographic characteristics did significantly improve prediction. The need for further work investigating the roles of fear and experience is discussed.},

Three randomized trials of respiratory rehabilitation provided data. We removed items one at a time from each domain in three orders: by item impact, item responsiveness, and at random. Responsiveness, test-retest reliability and construct validity were evaluated at each step. Responsiveness and reliability, evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), were reduced marginally as the number of items was reduced to two items per domain. The deterioration was greatest when reducing from two items to one. To detect a particular effect, sample size would increase by about 10\% when reducing the number of items in a domain to 2. Construct validity showed a more marked deterioration. Reducing to two items per domain would maintain responsiveness and reliability of the CRQ at an acceptable level, with a trade-off of reduced construct validity and increase in sample size requirements.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alterations of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function are well-established in adults with current depression. HPA alterations may persist into remission and confer increased risk for recurrence. METHODS: A modified version of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) was administered at baseline to 32 young adults with remitted major depressive disorder and 36 never-depressed controls. Participants were randomly assigned to either a 'high-stress' condition involving social evaluation or a 'low-stress' control condition. Cortisol concentrations were measured in saliva samples throughout the TSST. Participants were assessed again after 6 months for the occurrence of stressful life events and depressive symptoms/disorders during the follow-up period. RESULTS: Participants who exhibited enhanced cortisol reactivity in the low-stress condition showed increases in depressive symptoms over follow-up, after controlling for stressful life events during the follow-up period. Anticipatory stress cortisol and cortisol reactivity each interacted with history of depressive episodes to predict depression trajectories. LIMITATIONS: The single TSST administration limits conclusions about whether alterations of cortisol reactivity represent trait-like vulnerability factors or consequences ("scars') of past depression. CONCLUSIONS: These results extend previous findings on stress sensitivity in depression and suggest that altered HPA function during remission could reflect an endophenotype for vulnerability to depression recurrence. Findings support interactive models of risk for depression recurrence implicating HPA function, depression history, and sensitivity to minor stressors. Results may have implications for interventions that match treatment approaches to profiles of HPA function.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many patients report symptomatic relief after undergoing arthroscopy of the knee for osteoarthritis, but it is unclear how the procedure achieves this result. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of arthroscopy for osteoarthritis of the knee. METHODS: A total of 180 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were randomly assigned to receive arthroscopic débridement, arthroscopic lavage, or placebo surgery. Patients in the placebo group received skin incisions and underwent a simulated débridement without insertion of the arthroscope. Patients and assessors of outcome were blinded to the treatment-group assignment. Outcomes were assessed at multiple points over a 24-month period with the use of five self-reported scores--three on scales for pain and two on scales for function--and one objective test of walking and stair climbing. A total of 165 patients completed the trial. RESULTS: At no point did either of the intervention groups report less pain or better function than the placebo group. For example, mean (+/-SD) scores on the Knee-Specific Pain Scale (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more severe pain) were similar in the placebo, lavage, and débridement groups: 48.9+/-21.9, 54.8+/-19.8, and 51.7+/-22.4, respectively, at one year (P=0.14 for the comparison between placebo and lavage; P=0.51 for the comparison between placebo and débridement) and 51.6+/-23.7, 53.7+/-23.7, and 51.4+/-23.2, respectively, at two years (P=0.64 and P=0.96, respectively). Furthermore, the 95 percent confidence intervals for the differences between the placebo group and the intervention groups exclude any clinically meaningful difference. CONCLUSIONS: In this controlled trial involving patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, the outcomes after arthroscopic lavage or arthroscopic débridement were no better than those after a placebo procedure.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:The recovery of patients after an acute episode of illness or injury depends both on adequate medical treatment and on the early identification of needs for rehabilitation care. The process of early beginning rehabilitation requires efficient communication both between health professionals and the patient in order to effectively address all rehabilitation goals. The currently used nursing taxonomies, however, are not intended for interdisciplinary use and thus may not contribute to efficient rehabilitation management and an optimal patient outcome. The ICF might be the missing link in this communication process. The objective of this study was to identify the categories of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) categories relevant for nursing care in the situation of acute and early post-acute rehabilitation.METHODS:First, in a consensus process, "Leistungserfassung in der Pflege" (LEP) nursing interventions relevant for the situation of acute and early post-acute rehabilitation were selected. Second, in an integrated two-step linking process, two nursing experts derived goals of LEP nursing interventions from their practical knowledge and selected corresponding ICF categories most relevant for patients in acute and post-acute rehabilitation (ICF Core Sets).RESULTS:Eighty-seven percent of ICF Core Set categories could be linked to goals of at least one nursing intervention variable of LEP. The ICF categories most frequently linked with LEP nursing interventions were respiration functions, experience of self and time functions and focusing attention. Thirteen percent of ICF Core Set categories could not be linked with LEP nursing interventions. The LEP nursing interventions which were linked with the highest number of different ICF-categories of all were "therapeutic intervention", "patient-nurse communication/information giving" and "mobilising".CONCLUSION:The ICF Core Sets for the acute hospital and early post-acute rehabilitation facilities are highly relevant for rehabilitation nursing. Linking nursing interventions with ICF Core Set categories is a feasible way to analyse nursing. Using the ICF Core Sets to describe goals of nursing interventions both facilitates inter-professional communication and respects patient's needs. The ICF may thus be a useful framework to set nursing intervention goals.}

  abstract = {AIM This paper reports a systematic review on the outcomes of nursing diagnostics. Specifically, it examines effects on documentation of assessment quality; frequency, accuracy and completeness of nursing diagnoses; and on coherence between nursing diagnoses, interventions and outcomes. BACKGROUND Escalating healthcare costs demand the measurement of nursing's contribution to care. Use of standardized terminologies facilitates this measurement. Although several studies have evaluated nursing diagnosis documentation and their relationship with interventions and outcomes, a systematic review has not been carried out. METHOD A Medline, CINAHL, and Cochrane Database search (1982-2004) was conducted and enhanced by the addition of primary source and conference proceeding articles. Inclusion criteria were established and applied. Thirty-six articles were selected and subjected to thematic content analysis; each study was then assessed, and a level of evidence and grades of recommendations assigned. FINDINGS Nursing diagnosis use improved the quality of documented patient assessments (n = 14 studies), identification of commonly occurring diagnoses within similar settings (n = 10), and coherence among nursing diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes (n = 8). Four studies employed a continuing education intervention and found statistically significant improvements in the documentation of diagnoses, interventions and outcomes. However, limitations in diagnostic accuracy, reporting of signs/symptoms, and aetiology were also reported (14 studies). One meta-analysis of eight trials including 1497 patients showed no evidence that standardized electronic documentation of nursing diagnosis and related interventions led to better nursing outcomes. CONCLUSION Despite variable results, the trend indicated that nursing diagnostics improved assessment documentation, the quality of interventions reported, and outcomes attained. The study reveals deficits in reporting of signs/symptoms and aetiology. Consequently, staff educational measures to enhance diagnostic accuracy are recommended. The relationships among diagnoses, interventions and outcomes require further evaluation. Studies are needed to determine the relationship between the quality of documentation and practice.},

OBJECTIVES The purpose was to identify criteria for nursing diagnosis classifications and to assess how these criteria are met by different classifications. DESIGN/METHODS First, a literature review was conducted (N=50) to identify criteria for nursing diagnoses classifications and to evaluate how these criteria are met by the International Classification of Nursing Practice (ICNP), the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), the International Nursing Diagnoses Classification (NANDA), and the Nursing Diagnostic System of the Centre for Nursing Development and Research (ZEFP). Using literature review based general and specific criteria, the principal investigator evaluated each classification, applying a matrix. Second, a convenience sample of 20 nursing experts from different Swiss care institutions answered standardized interview forms, querying current national and international classification state and use. RESULTS The first general criterion is that a diagnosis classification should describe the knowledge base and subject matter for which the nursing profession is responsible. ICNP) and NANDA meet this goal. The second general criterion is that each class fits within a central concept. The ICF and NANDA are the only two classifications built on conceptually driven classes. The third general classification criterion is that each diagnosis possesses a description, diagnostic criteria, and related etiologies. Although ICF and ICNP describe diagnostic terms, only NANDA fulfils this criterion. The analysis indicated that NANDA fulfilled most of the specific classification criteria in the matrix. The nursing experts considered NANDA to be the best-researched and most widely implemented classification in Switzerland and internationally. CONCLUSIONS The international literature and the opinion of Swiss expert nurses indicate that-from the perspective of classifying comprehensive nursing diagnoses-NANDA should be recommended for nursing practice and electronic nursing documentation. Study limitations and future research needs are discussed.},

This paper summarizes the results of six studies. METHODS Two systematic reviews, instrument development and testing, a pre-post intervention study, and a cluster-randomized trial were performed. FINDINGS The NANDA International classification met most of the literature-based classification criteria, and results showed the Quality of Nursing Diagnoses, Interventions and Outcomes (Q-DIO) to be a reliable instrument to measure the documented quality of nursing diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes. Implementation of standardized nursing language significantly improved the quality of documented nursing diagnoses, related interventions, and patient outcomes. As a follow-up measure, Guided Clinical Reasoning (GCR) was effective in supporting nurses' clinical reasoning skills. CONCLUSIONS Carefully implementing classifications led to enhanced, accurately stated nursing diagnoses, more effective nursing interventions, and better patient outcomes. IMPLICATIONS Rethinking implementation methods for standardized language and using GCR is recommended. Based on the results of this study, the inclusion of NANDA International diagnoses with related interventions and outcomes in electronic health records is suggested.},

In Study 3, suppressing thoughts impaired subsequent efforts to control the expression of amusement and enjoyment. In Study 4, autobiographical accounts of successful versus failed emotional control linked prior regulatory demands and fatigue to self-regulatory failure.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The first democratic government elected in South Africa in 1994 inherited huge inequalities in health status and health provision across all sections of the population. This study set out to assess, 4 years later, the influence of race and socioeconomic status (SES) on perceived quality of care from health care providers. DESIGN: A 1998 countrywide survey of 3820 households assessed many aspects of health care delivery, including levels of satisfaction with health care providers among different segments of South African society. RESULTS: Fifty-one percent (n = 1953) of the respondents had attended a primary care facility in the year preceding the interview and were retained in the analysis. Both race and SES were significant predictors of levels of satisfaction with the services of the health care provider, after adjusting for gender, age, and type of facility visited. White and high SES respondents were about 1.5 times more likely to report excellent service compared with Black and low SES respondents, respectively. CONCLUSION: In South Africa, race and SES are not synonymous and can no longer be considered reliable proxy indicators of one another. Each has distinct and significant but different degrees of association with client satisfaction. Any assessment of equity-driven health policy in South Africa should consider the impacts of both race and SES on client satisfaction as one of the indicators of success.},

This systematic review seeks to estimate people’s attitudes toward, trust in, anxiety associated with, and acceptance of social robots; as well as factors that are associated with these beliefs. Ninety-seven studies were identified with a combined sample of over 13,000 participants and a standardized score was computed for each in order to represent the valence (positive, negative, or neutral) and magnitude (on a scale from 1 to −\,1) of people’s beliefs about robots. Potential moderating factors such as the robots’ domain of application and design, the type of exposure to the robot, and the characteristics of potential users were also investigated. The findings suggest that people generally have positive attitudes towards social robots and are willing to interact with them. This finding may challenge some of the existing doubt surrounding the adoption of robotics in social domains of application but more research is needed to fully understand the factors that influence attitudes.},

  abstract = {In this article we review some generalizations of classical theories of measurement for concatenation (e.g., mass or length) and conjoint structures (e.g., momentum of mass-velocity pairs or loudness of intensity-frequency pairs). The earlier results on additive representations are briefly surveyed. Generalizations to nonadditive structures are outlined, and their more complex uniqueness results are described. The latter leads to a definition of scale type in terms of the symmetries (automorphisms) of the underlying qualitative structure. The major result is that for any measurement onto the real numbers, only three possible scale types exist that are both rich in symmetries but not too redundant: ratio, interval, and another lying between them. The possible numerical representations for concatenation structures corresponding to these scale types are completely described. The interval scale case leads to a generalization of subjective expected-utility theory that copes with some empirical violations of the classical theory. Partial attempts to axiomatize concatenation structures of these three scale types are described. Such structures are of interest because they make clear that there is a rich class of nonadditive concatenation and conjoint structures with representations of the same scale types as those used in physics.},

The relationship between its qualitative and quantitative aspects has generated many theories and much controversy. In 19th century geometry similar developments led mathematician Felix Klein to devise a theory for unifying qualitative and quantitative approaches to geometry. Klein's theory, which today is called the Erlanger program, was based on transformation groups. In this article, the Erlanger program is given a new foundation based on mathematical logic and is extended to science. The current dominant theory of measurement in the literature, the representational theory, is then justified in terms of the new foundation for the Erlanger program. Certain inferential techniques used in dimensional analysis and the related technique of possible psychophysical laws are also given justifications in terms of the new foundation.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patient satisfaction is a function of several variables addressing reasons why it is important to use methods in which these different factors can be isolated and their importance analysed. OBJECTIVE: In this project, two methods using this approach were used: the 'Quality from the Patient's Perspective' and the 'Quality, Satisfaction, Performance' models. The aim of the present study is to evaluate these two different methods with respect to application, strengths and weaknesses. DESIGN: In the Quality from the Patient's Perspective model, the patient judges the different domains in two dimensions: perceived reality and subjective importance. The Quality, Satisfaction, Performance model uses a multivariate analysis to capture the patient's priorities. Four hundred and sixty forms for each model were distributed to a random sample of patients at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Karolinska Hospital. MAIN MEASURES: The quality factors 'treatment by the nurse', 'participation', 'information', 'environment' and 'accessibility' were measured. RESULTS: On both forms, 'medical care', 'treatment by the doctor' and 'access to nursing treatment' received high scores in perceived reality' while 'accessibility' and 'participation' received low scores. 'Subjective importance' measured directly and indirectly, respectively, in the two models showed high values for 'medical care' and 'treatment by the doctor'. CONCLUSION: The advantages of the Quality from the Patient's Perspective model are that it has a comprehensive and solid question bank. The Quality, Satisfaction, Performance model's advantage is its immediate usefulness and its clear graphic presentation. An integration and further development of these two approaches may prove useful.},

  abstract = {Beruf und Arbeit sind zentrale Faktoren unseres Lebens und haben großen Einfluss auf die Gestaltung des Alltags, indem sie ihn maßgeblich strukturieren und bestimmen. In der arbeitspsychologischen Forschung beschäftigt man sich seit langem mit der Bedeutung der Arbeit für den Menschen, ihren Wirkungen und Folgen. Die Frage, inwiefern sich eine ungesunde und risikoreiche Arbeitsumgebung negativ auf die Gesundheit auswirken kann, ist aber schon eine viel ältere und wurde insbesondere im Zuge der industriellen Revolution des 19. Jahrhunderts und ihren Folgen für das Arbeitsleben der Menschen aufgeworfen. Lag in den 60er und 70er Jahren des letzten Jahrhunderts der Fokus gesundheitsbezogener Überlegungen am Arbeitsplatz noch auf der Prävention von Unfällen und der Reduktion physischer Belastungen, zeigte sich in den letzten Jahrzehnten ein Wandel hin zur Betonung von arbeitsbedingten psychischen Belastungen und Erkrankungen (Buunk, de Jonge, Ybema \& de Wolff, 1998). Arbeitsplatzunsicherheit, stetig zunehmende Anforderungen sowie steigender Zeit- und Leistungsdruck bestimmen den heutigen Arbeitsalltag und fordern von vielen Arbeitnehmern ihren Tribut, So geht seit den 70er Jahren der Krankenstand, also die Dauer der krankheitsbedingten Abwesenheit vom Arbeitsplatz, in Deutschland zwar stetig zurück (Busch, 2006). Gleichzeitig steigt aber der Anteil an psychischen Erkrankungen als Ursache für Arbeitsunfähigkeit stetig an. Im Vergleich zum Jahr 2000 stieg der durch psychische Erkrankungen verursachte relative Anteil der Arbeitsunfähigkeitstage um 20\% und lag im Jahr 2006 an vierter Stelle der Ursachen für Arbeitsunfähigkeit (Lademann, Mertesacker \& Gebhardt, 2006), Dennoch werden trotz objektiv gleicher Arbeitsbelastungen nicht alle Menschen auf gleiche Weise beeinträchtigt.},

  abstract = {Gute Arbeit im Lehrbuchprogramm: Das Lehrbuch zum zweitgrößten und -beliebtesten Anwendungsgebiet der Psychologie hat sich zum Bestseller hochgearbeitet! Es erscheint nun in ergänzter und überarbeiteter 2. Auflage. Die Arbeits- und Organisationspsychologie beschäftigt sich mit dem Menschen im Kontext von Wirtschaft, Arbeitstätigkeit und Organisationen. Abgedeckt werden alle großen Bereiche Organisation, Personal und Arbeit: Wovon hängt es ab, ob jemand zufrieden mit seiner Arbeit ist? Welche Prozesse finden bei Fusionen und Unternehmensübernahmen statt? Wie funktioniert Personalentwicklung? Was ist organisationale Sozialisation'? U.v.m. Drei ausgewiesene Experten der AO-Psychologie beantworten diese Fragen fundiert und anschaulich. Neben den Grundlagen steht vor allem der Praxisbezug im Vordergrund. Die Kapitel sind didaktisch optimal für Lernen und Prüfungsvorbereitung aufbereitet. Auf www.lehrbuch-psychologie.de finden sich zahlreiche kostenlose Zusatzmaterialien: Lern-Tools für Studierende und Lehrmaterialien (u.a. Vorlesungs-Folien zum Download) für Dozenten. Das macht nicht nur Arbeit, sondern Spaß! Für Psychologie-Studierende und Studierende der Wirtschafts-, Ingenieurs- und Sozialwissenschaften.},

Es hat Auswirkungen auf die Leistung der Mitarbeiter, ihr subjektives Wohlbefinden und ihr Rückzugsverhalten, wobei es vermittelt über die Arbeitszufriedenheit und die Bindung an die Organisation wirkt. Das Konzept der Organisationskultur beschreibt tief verankerte Werte und Annahmen, die häufig den Organisationsmitgliedern nicht bewusst sind. Eine Organisation lässt sich wie eine „Minigesellschaft`` betrachten, die ihre eigene Geschichte hat, eine spezielle Sprache ausbildet, in der bestimmte Rituale und Zeremonien entstehen und die durch eigene Artefakte gekennzeichnet ist. Empirische Studien zeigen, dass Merkmale der Organisationskultur systematisch mit dem Erfolg des Unternehmens zusammenhängen.},

Zunächst wurde überprüft, ob sich die Dimensionen der partnerschaftlichen Bindung und die Liebesstile zu übergeordneten Dimensionen des Erlebens in Paarbeziehungen zusammenfassen ließen. Drei Dimensionen wurden gefunden: Distanzierung vom Partner, Verunsicherung in der Beziehung und Orientierung an Gemeinschaft und Austausch. An- schließend wurden Selbsteinschätzungen des Narzissmus zu diesen Dimensionen in Beziehung gesetzt. Narzissmus hing mit allen drei Dimensionen zusammen: Hoch Narzisstische tendierten zur Distanzierung vom Partner durch Untreue, zeigten Verunsicherung und Eifersucht und waren auf der Grundlage einer pragmatischen Einstellung stark austauschorientiert. Die Ergebnisse stützen die These, dass Narzissmus mit verschiedenen Dimensionen des Erlebens in Partnerschaften zusammenhängt.},

Die Autoren stellen ein Modell der Technikbereitschaft vor, nach dem individuelle Unterschiede in der Bereitschaft zum Umgang mit Technik in drei unterscheidbare Facetten untergliedert werden können: Technikakzeptanz, Technikkompetenz- und Technikkontrollüberzeugungen. Technikbereitschaft soll den erfolgreichen Umgang mit neuen Technologien insbesondere im höheren Lebensalter vorhersagen. Die Messeigenschaften einer neu entwickelten Skala wurden in drei Studien (N = 825) überprüft. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass das Modell der Technikbereitschaft empirisch bestätigt werden kann und das Instrument gute psychometrische Eigenschaften besitzt. Die Konstruktvalidität wurde über Zusammenhänge mit theoretisch einschlägigen Referenzkonstrukten (Techniknutzung, Persönlichkeit, Indikatoren erfolgreichen Alterns) sowie konkurrierend gegenüber anderen Maßen der Technikakzeptanz überprüft.},

  abstract = {Using the contest- and sponsored-mobility perspectives as theoretical guides, this meta-analysis reviewed 4 categories of predictors of objective and subjective career success: human capital, organizational sponsorship, sociodemographic status, and stable individual differences. Salary level and promotion served as dependent measures of objective career success, and subjective career success was represented by career satisfaction. Results demonstrated that both objective and subjective career success were related to a wide range of predictors. As a group, human capital and sociodemographic predictors generally displayed stronger relationships with objective career success, and organizational sponsorship and stable individual differences were generally more strongly related to subjective career success. Gender and time (date of the study) moderated several of the relationships examined.

Long-term meditators and nonmeditators were compared on measures of self-reported valence and arousal, skin conductance response (SCR), and facial electromyography (EMG) to masked and nonmasked emotional pictures, and on measures of heartbeat detection and self-reported emotional awareness. Groups responded similarly to nonmasked pictures. In the masked condition, only controls showed discrimination in valence self-reports. However, meditators reported greater emotional clarity than controls, and meditators with higher clarity had reduced arousal and improved valence discrimination in the masked condition. These findings provide qualified support for the somatic marker hypothesis and suggest that meditation may influence how emotionally ambiguous information is processed, regulated, and represented in conscious awareness.},

Seven experiments examined whether trait mindfulness--a disposition characterized by receptive attention to present experience--reduced defensive responses to mortality salience (MS). Under MS, less mindful individuals showed higher worldview defense (Studies 1-3) and self-esteem striving (Study 5), yet more mindful individuals did not defend a constellation of values theoretically associated with mindfulness (Study 4). To explain these findings through proximal defense processes, Study 6 showed that more mindful individuals wrote about their death for a longer period of time, which partially mediated the inverse association between trait mindfulness and worldview defense. Study 7 demonstrated that trait mindfulness predicted less suppression of death thoughts immediately following MS. The discussion highlights the relevance of mindfulness to theories that emphasize the nature of conscious processing in understanding responses to threat.},

Potential elements of attitudes were extracted from participants’ free descriptions and interviews, as well as a literature review. A questionnaire-based investigation was conducted using these elements, and a 12-factor structure was extracted employing factor analysis. A measurement called the Multi-dimensional Robot Attitude Scale was proposed to assess attitudes towards robots based on 12 dimensions. The internal reliability and representativeness of the proposed scale were verified. The Multi-dimensional Robot Attitude Scale proposed in this study is designed to comprehensively assess attitudes towards domestic robots, allowing for a multifaceted understanding of people’s attitudes.},

To better understand satisfaction in technology used in classrooms, a psychometric instrument was developed to identify and measure the specific factors of satisfaction with the technology in a business school setting. Additionally, this instrument is employed on a sample of business students as a means of reporting satisfaction levels with educational technology. We show that students' satisfaction with educational technology is related to four main factors: Proficiency, assessment, performance, and preference toward Web-courses.},

Thus, ambiguity--lacking information about another--leads to liking, whereas familiarity--acquiring more information--can breed contempt. This "less is more" effect is due to the cascading nature of dissimilarity: Once evidence of dissimilarity is encountered, subsequent information is more likely to be interpreted as further evidence of dissimilarity, leading to decreased liking. The authors document the negative relationship between knowledge and liking in laboratory studies and with pre- and postdate data from online daters, while showing the mediating role of dissimilarity.},

  abstract = {Emotional and neutral sounds rated for valence and arousal were used to investigate the influence of emotions on timing in reproduction and verbal estimation tasks with durations from 2 s to 6 s. Results revealed an effect of emotion on temporal judgment, with emotional stimuli judged to be longer than neutral ones for a similar arousal level. Within scalar expectancy theory (J. Gibbon, R. Church, \& W. Meck, 1984), this suggests that emotion-induced activation generates an increase in pacemaker rate, leading to a longer perceived duration. A further exploration of self-assessed emotional dimensions showed an effect of valence and arousal. Negative sounds were judged to be longer than positive ones, indicating that negative stimuli generate a greater increase of activation. High-arousing stimuli were perceived to be shorter than low-arousing ones. Consistent with attentional models of timing, this seems to reflect a decrease of attention devoted to time, leading to a shorter perceived duration. These effects, robust across the 2 tasks, are limited to short intervals and overall suggest that both activation and attentional processes modulate the timing of emotional events.},

PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to compare the effects of MBSR to a waiting-list control condition in a randomized controlled trial while examining potentially mediating effects of mindfulness. METHODS: Forty women and 20 men from the community with symptoms of distress (mean age 43.6 years, SD = 10.1) were randomized into a group receiving MBSR or a waiting-list control group. Before and after the intervention period, questionnaires were completed on psychological well-being, quality of life, and mindfulness. RESULTS: Repeated measures multiple analysis of variance (MANCOVAs) showed that, compared with the control group, the intervention resulted in significantly stronger reductions of perceived stress (p = 0.016) and vital exhaustion (p = 0.001) and stronger elevations of positive affect (p = 0.006), quality of life (p = .009), as well as mindfulness (p = 0.001). When mindfulness was included as a covariate in the MANCOVA, the group effects on perceived stress and quality of life were reduced to nonsignificance. CONCLUSION: Increased mindfulness may, at least partially, mediate the positive effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention.},

In this paper, we provide a background to the concept of empathy, and how it factors into learning. We then present our approach to equipping a robotic tutor with several empathic qualities, describing the technical architecture and its components, a map-reading learning scenario developed for an interactive multitouch table, as well as the pedagogical and empathic strategies devised for the robot. We also describe the results of a pilot study comparing the robotic tutor with these empathic qualities against a version of the tutor without them. The pilot study was performed with 26 school children aged 10–11 at their school. Results revealed that children in the test condition indeed rated the robot as more empathic than children in the control condition. Moreover, we explored several related measures, such as relational status and learning effect, yet no other significant differences were found. We further discuss these results and provide insights into future directions.},

Because the true population mean is unknown, this range describes possible values that the mean could be. If multiple samples were drawn from the same population and a 95\% CI calculated for each sample, we would expect the population mean to be found within 95\% of these CIs. CIs are sensitive to variability in the population (spread of values) and sample size. When used to compare the means of two or more treatment groups, a CI shows the magnitude of a difference between groups. This is helpful in understanding both the statistical significance and the clinical significance of a treatment. In this article we describe the basic principles of CIs and their interpretation.},

  abstract = {When it comes to evaluating online information experiences, what metrics matter? We conducted a study in which 30 people browsed and selected content within an online news website. Data collected included psychometric scales (User Engagement, Cognitive Absorption, System Usability Scales), self-reported interest in news content, and performance metrics (i.e., reading time, browsing time, total time, number of pages visited, and use of recommended links); a subset of the participants had their physiological responses recorded during the interaction (i.e., heart rate, electrodermal activity, electrocmytogram). Findings demonstrated the concurrent validity of the psychometric scales and interest ratings and revealed that increased time on tasks, number of pages visited, and use of recommended links were not necessarily indicative of greater self-reported engagement, cognitive absorption, or perceived usability. Positive ratings of news content were associated with lower physiological activity. The implications of this research are twofold. First, we propose that user experience is a useful framework for studying online information interactions and will result in a broader conceptualization of information interaction and its evaluation. Second, we advocate a mixed-methods approach to measurement that employs a suite of metrics capable of capturing the pragmatic (e.g., usability) and hedonic (e.g., fun, engagement) aspects of information interactions. We underscore the importance of using multiple measures in information research, because our results emphasize that performance and physiological data must be interpreted in the context of users' subjective experiences.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients seeking emergency and urgent care tend to experience a system, making choices about which service to use and making use of a number of services within a healthcare episode. The aim was to psychometrically test the Urgent Care System Questionnaire (UCSQ) for the routine measurement of the patient perspective of the emergency and urgent care system. METHODS: The UCSQ was developed based on qualitative research with recent users of the system. It consisted of a screening question to identify recent users and questions on the patient experience of, and satisfaction with, their most recent event. The acceptability, validity and reliability of the UCSQ were tested in a postal survey of 900 members of the general population and a telephone survey of a quota sample of 1000 members of the general population. RESULTS: The response rate to the postal survey was 51\% (457/893). In the telephone survey, 11604 calls were made to obtain a quota sample of 1014 people. These surveys identified 250 system users in the previous 3 months. A principal-components analysis identified three satisfaction components with good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha between 0.7 and 0.93): 'progress through the system' (10 items), 'entry into the system' (three items) and 'patient convenience' (five items). These components varied as expected by age and overall rating of the system. CONCLUSION: Preliminary testing suggests that the UCSQ has reasonable acceptability, validity and reliability. Further testing is required, particularly its responsiveness to changes in emergency and urgent care systems.},

  abstract = {Purpose.To identify and compare the concepts contained in questionnaires measuring mindfulness using the International Classification of Functioning (ICF) as external reference. Method.Questionnaires which are published in peer-reviewed journals and listed in Pubmed or PsycInfo were included. The questionnaires were analysed and, using a content-analytical approach, the respective items were categorised and linked to the ICF. Results.Ten questionnaires were included. Ninety-four per cent (N=341) of the concepts could be linked to 37 different ICF categories. One hundred and seventy-one (50.1\%) concepts were linked to ICF categories of the component Body Function, 74 (21.7\%) to categories of the component Activity and Participation and none to categories of the component Environmental Factors. In total, 28.2\% of the linked concepts belonged to Personal factors, which are not yet classified in the ICF. The questionnaires exhibited considerable differences regarding content density (i.e. The average number of concepts per item) and content diversity (i.e. The number of ICF categories per concept). Conclusions.The ICF provides an useful external reference to identify and compare the concepts contained in mindfulness questionnaires. Also, mindfulness questionnaire concepts suggest potentially useful factors for classification within the ICF. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Element distribution in the bark of two 20-year-old clones of Picea sitchensis following wounding was studied using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Bark was sampled at 0, 3, and 43 days after wounding and analysed using a focused Nd:YAG laser (266 nm). Intensities of (13) C, (25)Mg, (27)Al, (31)P, (32)S, (39)K, (48)Ca, (55)Mn, (57)Fe, (63)Cu and (64)Zn were measured by ICP-MS to study elemental distribution across the bark samples during the wound repair process. A clear accumulation of Mg, P and K at the boundary zone between the lesion and healthy tissue was detected in the wounded samples and was more distinctive at 43 than at 3 days after treatment. This zone of accumulation mapped onto the position of formation of the ligno-suberised boundary zone and differentiation of the wound periderm. These accumulations suggest major roles for Mg, P and K in the non-specific response of Sitka spruce both to wounding, possibly as co-factors to enzymes and energy utilisation. The LA-ICP-MS method developed in this work proved useful to study spatial element distribution across bark samples and has great potential for applications in other areas of plant pathology research.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genomic selection (GS) involves estimating breeding values using molecular markers spanning the entire genome. Accurate prediction of genomic breeding values (GEBVs) presents a central challenge to contemporary plant and animal breeders. The existence of a wide array of marker-based approaches for predicting breeding values makes it essential to evaluate and compare their relative predictive performances to identify approaches able to accurately predict breeding values. We evaluated the predictive accuracy of random forests (RF), stochastic gradient boosting (boosting) and support vector machines (SVMs) for predicting genomic breeding values using dense SNP markers and explored the utility of RF for ranking the predictive importance of markers for pre-screening markers or discovering chromosomal locations of QTLs. METHODS: We predicted GEBVs for one quantitative trait in a dataset simulated for the QTLMAS 2010 workshop. Predictive accuracy was measured as the Pearson correlation between GEBVs and observed values using 5-fold cross-validation and between predicted and true breeding values. The importance of each marker was ranked using RF and plotted against the position of the marker and associated QTLs on one of five simulated chromosomes. RESULTS: The correlations between the predicted and true breeding values were 0.547 for boosting, 0.497 for SVMs, and 0.483 for RF, indicating better performance for boosting than for SVMs and RF. CONCLUSIONS: Accuracy was highest for boosting, intermediate for SVMs and lowest for RF but differed little among the three methods and relative to ridge regression BLUP (RR-BLUP).},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to develop a theory-based and empirically tested instrument for measuring patient-reported 'psychosocial care by physicians'. We propose a model integrating patients' perceptions with respect to: (i) devotion by physicians, (ii) support by physicians, (iii) information by physicians and (iv) shared decision-making (SDM). DESIGN: Data were gathered during 2001 within a cross-sectional, retrospective mail survey. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: A total of 4192 inpatients of six German hospitals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Specific scales of the Cologne Patient Questionnaire were used. A two-step structural equation model procedure was applied. In the first structural equation model, all items were modeled as indicators of the intended underlying latent construct, 'psychosocial care by physicians'. In the second structural equation model, criterion-related validity of the intended construct was tested with respect to patients' 'satisfaction', 'trust in physicians' and the 'image of the hospital'. RESULTS: The results confirmed that the aspects of psychosocial care provided by physicians measured by the scale items are indeed indicators of the same construct. Furthermore, indicator reliabilities and selectivities revealed that the content of all 13 items was highly representative of the underlying construct. The second structural equation model showed that 'psychosocial care by physicians' is related to 'patients' satisfaction', 'trust in physicians' and 'hospital-image' in a significant and relevant manner. CONCLUSION: On the basis of our instrument's reported psychometric characteristics and of the initial validity indicators, it may be regarded as an adequate measure for further use in outcome and intervention research, and as a quality indicator for the physician-patient relationship.},

  abstract = {One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.RATIONALEThere is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P \&lt; .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size. Dotted line represents replication effect size of 0. Points below the dotted line were effects in the opposite direction of the original. Density plots are separated by significant (blue) and nonsignificant (red) effects.Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.}

  abstract = {In this research we claim that teachers' enthusiasm matters regarding student engagement in terms of academic cheating. Previous studies found that perceived enthusiasm of teachers is positively related to the intrinsic motivation of the students. However, it was less investigated how perceived enthusiasm is related to cheating. In the first exploratory questionnaire study (N = 244) we found that during the exams of those teachers who are perceived to be enthusiastic students tend to cheat less. In the second questionnaire study (N = 266) we took academic motivations into consideration and we found that the more teachers seem enthusiastic the cheating rate will be lower among university students. Aggregated teacher enthusiasm was positively related to intrinsic motivation, negatively related to amotivation, and not related to extrinsic motivation. Aggregated teacher enthusiasm was directly and negatively linked to cheating and it explained more variance in cheating than academic motivations together. These results suggest that teachers' perceived enthusiasm can be a yet unexplored interpersonal factor which could effectively prevent academic cheating.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To review and synthesize the state of research on a variety of meditation practices, including: the specific meditation practices examined; the research designs employed and the conditions and outcomes examined; the efficacy and effectiveness of different meditation practices for the three most studied conditions; the role of effect modifiers on outcomes; and the effects of meditation on physiological and neuropsychological outcomes. DATA SOURCES: Comprehensive searches were conducted in 17 electronic databases of medical and psychological literature up to September 2005. Other sources of potentially relevant studies included hand searches, reference tracking, contact with experts, and gray literature searches. REVIEW METHODS: A Delphi method was used to develop a set of parameters to describe meditation practices. Included studies were comparative, on any meditation practice, had more than 10 adult participants, provided quantitative data on health-related outcomes, and published in English. Two independent reviewers assessed study relevance, extracted the data and assessed the methodological quality of the studies. RESULTS: Five broad categories of meditation practices were identified (Mantra meditation, Mindfulness meditation, Yoga, Tai Chi, and Qi Gong). Characterization of the universal or supplemental components of meditation practices was precluded by the theoretical and terminological heterogeneity among practices. Evidence on the state of research in meditation practices was provided in 813 predominantly poor-quality studies. The three most studied conditions were hypertension, other cardiovascular diseases, and substance abuse. Sixty-five intervention studies examined the therapeutic effect of meditation practices for these conditions. Meta-analyses based on low-quality studies and small numbers of hypertensive participants showed that TM(R), Qi Gong and Zen Buddhist meditation significantly reduced blood pressure. Yoga helped reduce stress. Yoga was no better than Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction at reducing anxiety in patients with cardiovascular diseases. No results from substance abuse studies could be combined. The role of effect modifiers in meditation practices has been neglected in the scientific literature. The physiological and neuropsychological effects of meditation practices have been evaluated in 312 poor-quality studies. Meta-analyses of results from 55 studies indicated that some meditation practices produced significant changes in healthy participants. CONCLUSIONS: Many uncertainties surround the practice of meditation. Scientific research on meditation practices does not appear to have a common theoretical perspective and is characterized by poor methodological quality. Firm conclusions on the effects of meditation practices in healthcare cannot be drawn based on the available evidence. Future research on meditation practices must be more rigorous in the design and execution of studies and in the analysis and reporting of results.},

  abstract = {In this article, we discuss cognitive load measurement techniques with regard to their contribution to cognitive load theory (CLT). CLT is concerned with the design of instructional methods that efficiently use people's limited cognitive processing capacity to apply acquired knowledge and skills to new situations (i.e., transfer). CLT is based on a cognitive architecture that consists of a limited working memory with partly independent processing units for visual and auditory information, which interacts with an unlimited long-term memory. These structures and functions of human cognitive architecture have been used to design a variety of novel efficient instructional methods. The associated research has shown that measures of cognitive load can reveal important information for CLT that is not necessarily reflected by traditional performance-based measures. Particularly, the combination of performance and cognitive load measures has been identified to constitute a reliable estimate of the mental efficiency of instructional methods. The discussion of previously used cognitive load measurement techniques and their role in the advancement of CLT is followed by a discussion of aspects of CLT that may benefit by measurement of cognitive load. Within the cognitive load framework, we also discuss some promising new techniques.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to adapt and validate an instrument for assessing quality of care from the patients' perspective in the context of Chilean primary care. METHODS: The 'Health Centre Assessment Questionnaire' is made up of six multiple-item scales and two single-item scales addressing eight key areas of primary care activity. A further two single-item scales ask about the overall satisfaction and the way in which the centre deals with patients' health issues. The adaptation process was developed according to methods described in the specialized literature. The instrument was initially pre-tested in a sample of 100 primary care patients. The validation was carried out in 10 urban public primary healthcare centres where 2896 patients were invited to complete the questionnaire. The validity and reliability of the instrument was assessed using standard psychometric techniques. RESULTS: Ninety nine per cent (2870) of those approached completed the questionnaire. It was acceptable to most of the patients as reflected by the high response rate, and a full range of possible scores in most of the scales. Reliability was good as reflected by high internal consistency and homogeneity. Validity was supported by the confirmation of scaling assumptions, the moderate correlations between multiple-item scales, and by the confirmation of our 'a priori' hypothesis. CONCLUSIONS: The questionnaire could be a useful instrument for assessing a number of important dimensions in Chilean primary care. It is acceptable, reliable and valid. Further work is required to evaluate its validity against external criteria and its test-retest reliability.},

Based on self-efficacy theory and self-worth theory of achievement-motivation, it is hypothesized that the relationship between computer anxiety and job satisfaction is curvilinear and attitude towards computer moderates such relationship. The relationship between computer anxiety and career satisfaction and job stress were empirically examined in this study. Two hundred and thirty undergraduate students (125 female and 105 male students) at a university in south-western part of Louisiana completed computer anxiety, computer attitude, job satisfaction, career satisfaction and stress surveys. Hierarchical moderated regression results support that the attitude towards computer acts as a moderator in the relationship between (i) computer anxiety and stress, (ii) computer anxiety and job satisfaction, and (iii) computer anxiety and career satisfaction. Implications for management are discussed.},

The relationship link between terminologies and SNOMED-CT is provided in a mapping table, which identifies the source terminology. The purpose of this study is to examine the validity of the cross-mapping between the source system (NIC) and the target system (SNOMED-CT) using the methodology developed by Lu and colleagues to detect misassigned concepts. Knowledge representation concepts in the NIC and SNOMED-CT systems were compared using expert human judgment. Of 514 NIC concepts, 14 (2.7\%) were identified as misassigned in SNOMED-CT. Two inappropriate representations of concepts were discovered in NIC. Results and recommendations were given to NIC and to SNOMED-CT. (C) 2007 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

We describe a method for assessing personality using an open-vocabulary analysis of language from social media. We compiled the written language from 66,732 Facebook users and their questionnaire-based self-reported Big Five personality traits, and then we built a predictive model of personality based on their language. We used this model to predict the 5 personality factors in a separate sample of 4,824 Facebook users, examining (a) convergence with self-reports of personality at the domain- and facet-level; (b) discriminant validity between predictions of distinct traits; (c) agreement with informant reports of personality; (d) patterns of correlations with external criteria (e.g., number of friends, political attitudes, impulsiveness); and (e) test-retest reliability over 6-month intervals. Results indicated that language-based assessments can constitute valid personality measures: they agreed with self-reports and informant reports of personality, added incremental validity over informant reports, adequately discriminated between traits, exhibited patterns of correlations with external criteria similar to those found with self-reported personality, and were stable over 6-month intervals. Analysis of predictive language can provide rich portraits of the mental life associated with traits. This approach can complement and extend traditional methods, providing researchers with an additional measure that can quickly and cheaply assess large groups of participants with minimal burden.},

Results from 29 empirical studies examining emotional Stroop or dot probe results in depressed participants (clinical depression, nonclinical dysphoria, and subjects undergoing depressive mood induction) were examined. Studies using the emotional Stroop task yielded marginally significant evidence of a difference between depressed and nondepressed samples, whereas those using the dot probe task showed significant differences between groups (d = 0.52). We found no evidence for significant moderation of these effects by age, sex, type of depressed sample, year of publication, stimulus presentation duration, or type of stimuli (verbal or nonverbal), although statistical power for these tests was limited. These results support the existence of biased attention to negative information in depression. Depression and Anxiety, 2010.© 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

They suffered from dementias of medium level (DSM III, Category 1, ICD No. 299), and had been residents in an old age home longer than 3 months at the start of the trial. The patients were treated first for 2 weeks by placebo tablets and their initial performance was recorded during this period by using the Nuremberg Gerontopsychological Inventory (NAI). This was then followed by a treatment for 8 weeks with the nootropic drug, centrophenoxine (CPH), the dose of which was 2 g/day distributed in 2 x 2 tablets of Helfergin500 (Promonta, Hamburg, FRG), or with placebo tablets of identical size, then the NAI test was repeated again. Verum or placebo treatment was selected randomly and the code was revealed only after having elaborated all the results of the trial. During the treatment period four drop-outs occurred for intercurrent diseases. Evaluation was based on a semi-quantitative, intra-individual comparison of the performance before and after treatment. The results obtained suggest that CPH treatment may be useful in dementias of medium level in quite old groups of patients, since 48\% of the verum group displayed improvements in the memory functions against 28\% of the placebo group. CPH seems to be a useful and harmless drug in the treatment and most probably also in prevention of the dementias.},

The second study examined associations between scores on questionnaire measures of fear/anxiety and performance in a military training setting; regression analysis revealed that fear captured significant variance in performance that was not shared with anxiety. These results imply that hypotheses derived from nonhuman animal data may hold important implications for understanding human emotion and motivation, especially in relation to fear and anxiety.},

  abstract = {Study Objectives: To identify determinants of patient satisfaction with emergency house calls and to assess the properties of a satisfaction measurement questionnaire.; Design: Patient survey, combined with routinely collected information on the circumstances of the house call.; Setting: Emergency house calls provided by an independent emergency care organization (ECO) in Geneva, Switzerland.; Participants: Consecutive sample of 389 patients (67\% response rate).; Main Outcome Measure: Patient satisfaction.; Predictor Variables: patient age and sex, type of medical problem, time of visit, waiting time, duration of visit, perceived effectiveness of treatment.; Results: The satisfaction questionnaire was easy to administer. Factor analysis identified 3 separate dimensions of satisfaction, which pertained to the visit itself, to access and to general attitude toward the ECO. Validation tests were consistent with expectations. In multivariate analysis, older patient age and greater perceived treatment effectiveness predicted independently all satisfaction scales. Presence of a mixed physical and mental problem reduced satisfaction with the visit itself only, a delay between the phone call and the visit exceeding one hour reduced satisfaction with access and worsened the attitude toward the ECO.; Conclusion: The instrument used to measure patient satisfaction with emergency house calls performed well. Overall levels of satisfaction were high. Perceived effectiveness of treatment was the strongest correlate of patient satisfaction. Monitoring of patient satisfaction in emergency settings may contribute to improvements of quality of care.;},

  abstract = {The goal of this study was to develop and validate a self-completed questionnaire, the Fibromyalgia Rapid Screening Tool (FiRST), for the detection of fibromyalgia syndrome in patients with diffuse chronic pain. Items requiring "yes/no" responses and relating to the most relevant clinical characteristics of fibromyalgia were compiled by a group of rheumatologists and pain experts. The provisional questionnaire was tested in a prospective multicenter study of 162 patients with chronic pain due to fibromyalgia (according to ACR criteria) (n=92) compared with a group of patients with chronic diffuse pain due to other rheumatic conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis (n=32), ankylosing spondylitis (n=25) and osteoarthritis (n=13). Identification of the most discriminant combinations of items for fibromyalgia and the calculation of their sensitivity and specificity were based on both univariate and multivariate (stepwise logistic regression) analyses. The assessment of the psychometric properties of the questionnaire also dealt with face validity, content validity, test-retest reliability and convergent/divergent validity. Based on univariate and multivariate analyses, we retained only six items in the final version of FiRST. These items were used to calculate the sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of the questionnaire. A cut-off score of 5 (corresponding to the number of positive items) gave the highest rate of correct identification of patients (87.9\%), with a sensitivity of 90.5\% and a specificity of 85.7\%. In conclusion, FiRST is a brief, simple and straightforward self-administered questionnaire with excellent discriminative value, of potential value for the detection of fibromyalgia in both daily practice and clinical research.},

  abstract = {Attitudes towards artificial intelligence (AI) and social robots are often depicted as different in Japan, compared to other western countries, such as Sweden. Several different reasons for why there are general differences in attitudes have been suggested. In this study, five hypotheses based on previous literature were investigated. Rather than attempting to establish general differences between groups, subjects were sampled from the respective populations, and correlations between the hypothesized confounding factors and attitudes were investigated within the groups between individuals. The hypotheses in this exploratory study concerned: (H1) animistic beliefs in inanimate objects and phenomena, (H2) worry about unemployment due to AI deployment, (H3) perceived positive or negative portrayal of AI in popular culture, (H4) familiarity with AI, and (H5) relational closeness and privacy with AI. No clear correlations between attitudes and animistic belief (H1), or portrayal of AI in popular culture (H3) could be observed. When it comes to the other attributes, worry about unemployment (H2), familiarity with AI (H4), and relational closeness and privacy (H5), the correlations were similar for the individuals in both groups and in line with the hypotheses. Thus, the general picture following this exploratory study is that individuals in the two populations are more alike than different.},

Anschließend wurden die Modellfaktoren des revidierten Modells der Schutzmotivation (Arthur \& Quester, 2004) erhoben. Die Ergebnisse stützen die Hypothese, dass die Faktoren «Schweregrad der Schädigung» und «Wahrscheinlichkeit der Schädigung» die Verhaltenswahrscheinlichkeit, weniger oder leichtere Zigaretten zu rauchen, vermittelt über den Mediator «Furcht» beeinflussen. Die Verhaltenswahrscheinlichkeit wurde dagegen nicht von den drei experimentellen Bedingungen beeinflusst. Auch konnten die Faktoren «Handlungswirksamkeitserwartungen» und «Selbstwirksamkeitserwartungen» nicht als Moderatoren des Zusammenhangs zwischen Furcht und Verhaltenswahrscheinlichkeit bestätigt werden.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: . To describe the development of the Patient Experiences Questionnaire (PEQ) and to evaluate reliability and validity of constructed summed rating scales. DESIGN: Literature review, focus groups and pilot surveys. Two national cross-sectional studies performed in 1996 and 1998. SETTING: Two postal surveys in a national sample of 14 hospitals stratified by geographical region and hospital size. Subjects. Patients consecutively discharged from surgical wards and wards of internal medicine. The surveys included 36 845 patients and 19 578 responded (53\%). RESULTS: We constructed 10 summed rating scales based on factor analysis and theoretical considerations: Information on future complaints, Nursing services, Communication, Information examinations, Contact with next-of-kin, Doctor services, Hospital and equipment, Information medication, Organization and General satisfaction. Eight scales had a Cronbach alpha coefficient of {$>$}0.70, the remaining two were {$>$}0.60. Repeatability was {$>$}0.70 for five scales and {$>$}0.60 for the remaining scales. CONCLUSIONS: The PEQ is a self-report instrument covering the most important subjects of interest to hospital patients. Results are presented as 10 scales with good validity and reliability. It emphasizes practicability and comprehensibility while at the same time providing sufficient information about domains applicable to most patients admitted to medical and surgical wards.},

  abstract = {Die Bedeutung von Optionsstress und Zeitdruck in der modernen Arbeitswelt wird erörtert. Von Optionsstress wird gesprochen, wenn eine Person in einer Situation, die sich durch viele oder komplexe Optionen auszeichnet, zur Einschätzung gelangt, dass diese Situation ihre Ressourcen beansprucht oder übersteigt und ihr Wohlbefinden gefährdet. Optionsstress wird als ein Grundproblem des Menschen dargestellt, das durch die Modernisierung der Gesellschaft an Bedeutung gewinnt. Des Weiteren wird die These einer zweigeteilten Arbeitswelt entfaltet: In der strukturierten Arbeitswelt werden standardisierte Aufgaben in strukturierter Form abgearbeitet, so dass Optionsmangel das vorherrschende Merkmal ist. Die unstrukturierte Arbeitswelt zeichnet sich hingegen durch geringe Standardisierung, geringe Formalisierung und wenig festes Wissen sowie große Optionsräume aus. Konsequenzen dieser Zweiteilung für die Wissensarbeiter und andere Arbeitstätige werden verdeutlicht. In der Folge werden zum Verhältnis zwischen Optionsstress und Zeitdruck zwei Thesen aufgestellt: Optionslast führt zu Zeitdruck, Zeitdruck führt zu Optionsstress. Zur Eindämmumg von Optionsstress werden drei Maßnahmen genannt: (1) individuelles Training der Fähigkeit zu Optionsstressreduktion und Mehroptionsfähigkeit, (2) Strategien der sozialen Entscheidungsentlastung und (3) Strategien der sozialen Optionsreduktion.},

A self-report measure of student self-efficacy, intrinsic value, test anxiety, self-regulation, and use of learning strategies was administered, and performance data were obtained from work on classroom assignments. Self-efficacy and intrinsic value were positively related to cognitive engagement and performance. Regression analyses revealed that, depending on the outcome measure, self-regulation, self-efficacy, and test anxiety emerged as the best predictors of performance. Intrinsic value did not have a direct influence on performance but was strongly related to self-regulation and cognitive strategy use, regardless of prior achievement level. The implications of individual differences in motivational orientation for cognitive engagement and self-regulation in the classroom are discussed.},

The model is formalized as a production system capable of acquiring new production rules based on problem-solving experience. The model and protocols suggest that (a) problem solving by analogy to worked-out examples is frequent in initial attempts by novices to write recursive functions; (b) different representations of examples are used to guide problem solving by analogy; and (c) performance on later problems reflects the particular representations used in problem solving by analogy on earlier problems. The protocols and simulations also suggest that learning is facilitated by using abstract representations of the structure of recursion examples to guide initial coding attempts.

  abstract = {The occurrence of phasic reductions of EMG activity during non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep in man and cat are described, and an analysis of the phenomenon in man is presented. Twelve subjects (ten male, two female) slept a total of 107 nights in the sleep laboratory. Standard recordings were taken of electroencephalographic (EEG), electrooculographic (EOG), and electromyographic (EMG) activity. Suppressions of EMG were observed in all subjects during all stages of non-REM sleep, but occurred with the greatest frequency during stages 2 and 4. The suppressions averaged 250 msec in duration and exhibited a higher frequency in the 10 min immediately prior to REM periods than in the 10 min immediately subsequent to REM periods. The relationship between the H reflex and phasic EMG suppressions was examined in three subjects (two males, one female) who were recorded a total of 9 nights. In addition to standard EEG, EOG, and EMG derivations, the H reflex was elicited by electrical stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve, recorded from the soleus muscle, and viewed on an oscilloscope. The EEG, EMG, and soleus muscle action potentials were recorded on magnetic tape. In all subjects it was found that whenever a stimulus occurred coincidental with a phasic EMG reduction, the reflex response was invariably inhibited. The observation and verification of phasic activity during non-REM sleep in the human subject is related to recent data in the cat, and the application of this physiological event to studies of non-REM mentation is discussed.},

  abstract = {Mindfulness is a mental state that can be achieved through meditation. So far, studies have shown that practicing mindfulness on a consistent and regular basis can improve attentional functions and emotional well-being. Mindfulness has recently begun to be used in the field of child development. The goal of this study is to assess if a mindfulness program may help primary school students in reducing anxiety and depression while also improving their temperamental characteristics. This multi-arm pre-post study included 41 subjects recruited in the fifth year of two primary school classes. Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. The experimental group, but not the control group, underwent an eight-week mindfulness training. Every week, the program included 60-min group sessions. QUIT (Italian Questionnaires of Temperament) and TAD (Test for Anxiety and Depression in Childhood and Adolescence) were used to assess temperament, and anxiety and depression, respectively. Both groups were administered both instruments before and after mindfulness intervention. The mindfulness program lowered anxiety levels and was effective in changing temperament dimensions: there was an increase in social orientation (SO), positive emotionality (PE), and attention (AT), as well as a decrease in inhibition to novelty (IN) and negative emotionality. Path analysis revealed that AT may promote the improvement of both SO and IN. Similarly, PE may be promoted by the decrease of IN. Clinical implications are discussed.},

Fuchs 1 Regional Primate Research Center and Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195-7330Submitted 13 September 1999.accepted in final form 11 May 2000.Abstract To investigate whether the simian light reflex is a reasonable model for the human light reflex, we elicited pupillary responses in three behaving rhesus macaques. We measured the change in pupillary area in response to brief (100 ms), intermediate (1 s), and long (3--5 s) light flashes delivered by light-emitting diodes while the monkey fixated a stationary target. Individual responses in the same monkey to either 100-ms or 1-s stimuli of the same light intensity were quite variable. Nevertheless, in response to the 100-ms stimulus, average pupillary constriction and peak constriction velocity increased and latency decreased linearly with the log of stimulus luminance. The minimum average constriction latency across monkeys for the brightest flash was 136 ms. A linear decrease of constriction latency with stimulus luminance also occurs in humans, but their latencies are ∼70 ms longer. In addition, peak constriction velocity was highly correlated with the decrease in pupillary area. Dilation metrics were not as well related to stimulus luminance as were constriction metrics. The latency from flash offset to the onset of dilation was relatively constant, averaging ∼480 ms. Peak dilation velocity was also correlated, but less well, with the increase in pupillary area. Constriction generally was greater and of longer duration for 1-s light pulses than for 100-ms pulses of equal luminance. The initial time courses of the responses to the two stimuli of different durations were identical until ∼150 ms after response onset. Human pupillary responses for long and short flashes also have identical initial time courses. For very long (3--5 s) and very bright constant-luminance stimuli, the simian pupil underwent oscillations at frequencies of 0.9--1.6 Hz. Similar oscillations, called hippus, occur in the human pupillary light reflex. Like humans, the monkeys also exhibited consensual and binocular pupillary responses. Except for response latency, the pupillary responses in the two primate species are otherwise quite similar. Therefore any knowledge we gain about the neuronal substrate of the simian light reflex can be expected to have considerable relevance when extrapolated to humans.

This study reviewed research to analyse educational outcomes for children learning to code at school. A systematic review was applied to identify relevant articles and a thematic analysis to synthesise the findings. Ten articles were included in the synthesis and an overarching model was developed which depicts the themes. The results demonstrate that although students are learning to code, a range of other educational outcomes can be learnt or practiced through the teaching of coding. These included mathematical problem-solving, critical thinking, social skills, self-management and academic skills. The review also identified the importance of instructional design for developing these educational outcomes through coding.},

The mRNA-based vaccines had the highest level of side effects reported except for diarrhea and arthralgia. Aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines had the lowest systemic and local side effects between vaccines’ adjuvant or without adjuvant, except for injection site redness. The adenovirus-vectored and mRNA-based vaccines for COVID-19 showed the highest efficacy after first and second doses, respectively. The mRNA-based vaccines had higher side effects.

The root mean square of the EMG activity was determined from four 4-s samples taken at 30-s intervals, during 2 min of standing in each of five positions of simulated KFC (0 degree, 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees and 40 degrees). A randomly balanced order of conditions was used. KFC were simulated in each subject by means of an adjustable line from the subject's waist to the sole of each foot. An analysis of variance was used to contrast EMG activity, and a significant difference was found between each of the positions (P less than 0.05). The mean (+/- 1 SD) EMG activity, expressed as a percentage of the maximum voluntary contraction, was 0.3\% (+/- 0.2) at 0 degree, 7.6\% (+/- 5.6) at 10 degrees, 10.9\% (+/- 7.6) at 20 degrees, 16.6\% (+/- 12.4) at 30 degrees and 24.0\% (+/- 14.0) at 40 degrees. A linear relationship was found (r2 = 0.986), expressed by the equation y = 0.62 + 0.56 x, where y represents EMG activity and x represents the extent of simulated KFC (P = 0.0007). The results provide insight into the increased knee extensor activity necessary to stand with KFC and underline the importance of treating this common disorder.},

  abstract = {As computers became ubiquitous in businesses, homes, and schools, there was increasing concern about computer anxiety and its effect on individuals. The first academic articles on computer anxiety were published in the early 1980s. Since that time, hundreds of papers have been published on the topic. Yet, up to this time, no one has done a comprehensive review of computer anxiety. In this article, 276 articles on computer anxiety are reviewed. From a synthesis of the articles and variables studied to date, a framework is developed that outlines the primary topics studied in computer anxiety literature. Nine antecedents, five correlates, and two outcomes of computer anxiety are identified as the most studied variables in the literature. In addition, a statistical comparison is done to compare the distribution of computer anxiety topics and results published in the 1990s to those published in the 2000s. Suggestions for future research in computer anxiety are proposed.},

  abstract = {Abstract The task of modeling the distribution of a large number of tree species under future climate scenarios presents unique challenges. First, the model must be robust enough to handle climate data outside the current range without producing unacceptable instability in the output. In addition, the technique should have automatic search mechanisms built in to select the most appropriate values for input model parameters for each species so that minimal effort is required when these parameters are fine-tuned for individual tree species. We evaluated four statistical models---Regression Tree Analysis (RTA), Bagging Trees (BT), Random Forests (RF), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)---for predictive vegetation mapping under current and future climate scenarios according to the Canadian Climate Centre global circulation model. To test, we applied these techniques to four tree species common in the eastern United States: loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and white oak (Quercus alba). When the four techniques were assessed with Kappa and fuzzy Kappa statistics, RF and BT were superior in reproducing current importance value (a measure of basal area in addition to abundance) distributions for the four tree species, as derived from approximately 100,000 USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis plots. Future estimates of suitable habitat after climate change were visually more reasonable with BT and RF, with slightly better performance by RF as assessed by Kappa statistics, correlation estimates, and spatial distribution of importance values. Although RTA did not perform as well as BT and RF, it provided interpretive models for species whose distributions were captured well by our current set of predictors. MARS was adequate for predicting current distributions but unacceptable for future climate. We consider RTA, BT, and RF modeling approaches, especially when used together to take advantage of their individual strengths, to be robust for predictive mapping and recommend their inclusion in the ecological toolbox.},

  abstract = {Researchers often conduct mediation analysis in order to indirectly assess the effect of a proposed cause on some outcome through a proposed mediator. The utility of mediation analysis stems from its ability to go beyond the merely descriptive to a more functional understanding of the relationships among variables. A necessary component of mediation is a statistically and practically significant indirect effect. Although mediation hypotheses are frequently explored in psychological research, formal significance tests of indirect effects are rarely conducted. After a brief overview of mediation, we argue the importance of directly testing the significance of indirect effects and provide SPSS and SAS macros that facilitate estimation of the indirect effect with a normal theory approach and a bootstrap approach to obtaining confidence intervals, as well as the traditional approach advocated by Baron and Kenny (1986). We hope that this discussion and the macros will enhance the frequency of formal mediation tests in the psychology literature. Electronic copies of these macros may be downloaded from the Psychonomic Society's Web archive at www.psychonomic.org/archive/.},

  abstract = {Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) strengthens synapses that are activated immediately before a postsynaptic spike, and weakens those that are activated after a spike. To prevent an uncontrolled growth of the synaptic strengths, weakening must dominate strengthening for uncorrelated spike times. However, this weight-normalization property would preclude Hebbian potentiation when the pre- and postsynaptic neurons are strongly active without specific spike-time correlations. We show that nonlinear STDP as inherent in the data of Markram et al. (1997) Science 275:213-215 can preserve the benefits of both weight normalization and Hebbian plasticity, and hence can account for learning based on spike-time correlations and on mean firing rates. As examples we consider the moving-threshold property of the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro rule, the development of direction-selective simple cells by changing short-term synaptic depression, and the joint adaptation of axonal and dendritic delays. Without threshold nonlinearity at low frequencies, the development of direction selectivity does not stabilize in a natural stimulation environment. Without synaptic unreliability there is no causal development of axonal and dendritic delays},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The effects of burnout and perceived stress on early morning free cortisol levels after awakening were investigated in a group of teachers. Previous studies revealed that cortisol levels show a significant increase after awakening, with high intraindividual stability. METHODS: Sixty-six teachers from local public schools (42 women and 24 men, mean age 42 ± 5 years) were asked to sample saliva for cortisol analysis on 3 consecutive days. On each day, cortisol levels were measured at the time of awakening and 15, 30, and 60 minutes thereafter. On the night before the third day, subjects took 0.5 mg dexamethasone orally for testing glucocorticoid feedback inhibition. Burnout and perceived stress were measured by three different questionnaires. RESULTS: Perceived stress correlated with increases of cortisol levels during the first hour after awakening after dexamethasone pretreatment. In addition, teachers scoring high on burnout showed lower overall cortisol secretion on all sampling days, and a higher suppression of cortisol secretion after dexamethasone administration. In the subgroup of teachers with both high levels of perceived stress and high levels of burnout, a lower overall cortisol secretion was observed on the first 2 days, with stronger increases during the first hour after awakening after dexamethasone suppression. This subgroup also showed the lowest self-esteem, the highest external locus of control, and the highest number of somatic complaints. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate differential effects of burnout and perceived stress on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation.}

The accuracy of our predictions depends on the quality of our present knowledge and accuracy of our observations. Weather forecasts are a familiar example---the more we know about how weather works, the better we can use current observations and seasonal records to predict whether it will rain tomorrow and any disagreement between prediction and observation can be used to refine the weather model. Bayesian statistics embodies this cycle of applying previous theoretical and empirical knowledge to formulate hypotheses, rank them on the basis of observed data and update prior probability estimates and hypotheses using observed data1. This will be our first of a series of columns about Bayesian statistics. This month, we'll introduce the topic using one of its key concepts---Bayes' theorem---and expand to include topics such as Bayesian inference and networks in future columns.},

  abstract = {A wealth of research has established that practice tests improve memory for the tested material. Although the benefits of practice tests are well documented, the mechanisms underlying testing effects are not well understood. We propose the mediator effectiveness hypothesis, which states that more-effective mediators (that is, information linking cues to targets) are generated during practice involving tests with restudy versus during restudy only. Effective mediators must be retrievable at time of test and must elicit the target response. We evaluated these two components of mediator effectiveness for learning foreign language translations during practice involving either test-restudy or restudy only. Supporting the mediator effectiveness hypothesis, test-restudy practice resulted in mediators that were more likely to be retrieved and more likely to elicit targets on a final test.},

  abstract = {Hyland, Lee, and Mills (2015) specified the two most popular scales for mindfulness: the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI; 30 items, Buchheld, Grossman, \& Walach, 2001; 14 items, Walach, Buchheld, Buttenmüller, Kleinknecht, \& Schmidt, 2006) and the Mindfulness Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS; Brown \& Ryan, 2003). However, the popularity of these measures does not necessarily mean that they are of high quality. Especially considering the complex epistemology and ontology of the mindfulness construct, we should apply mindfulness assessments with caution. More specially, according to item development theorists in the industrial and organizational (I-O) area (see Hinkin, 1998; Hinkin \& Tracey, 1999; Kerlinger \& Lee, 2000; Schriesheim, Powers, Scandura, Gardiner, \& Lankau, 1993), scholars must select measures that have (a) a clear operational definition; (b) alignment between definition and measure (content validity); (c) high reliability and (d) high construct validity; and (e) high criterion-related validity. However, it is not clear which of the available mindfulness assessments satisfies these criteria and to what extent. In this commentary, we assess currently used measures based on these criteria and provide directions for future research.},

Overall, results indicated a peak in prejudice in middle childhood (5-7 years) followed by a slight decrease until late childhood (8-10 years). In addition to differences for the various operationalizations of prejudice, detailed findings revealed different age-related changes in prejudice toward higher versus lower status out-groups and positive effects of contact opportunities with the out-group on prejudice development. Results confirm that prejudice changes systematically with age during childhood but that no developmental trend is found in adolescence, indicating the stronger influence of the social context on prejudice with increasing age.},

  abstract = {The connection between race and intelligence has been a subject of debate in both popular science and academic research since the inception of IQ testing in the early 20th century. Since then, there have been observed differences between average IQ scores of different population groups, but whether and to what extent these differences reflect environmental factors as opposed to genetic ones, as well as what the definitions of "race" and "intelligence" are, and whether they can be objectively defined, is the subject of much debate. At present, there is no non-circumstantial evidence that these differences in test scores have a genetic component, although some researchers believe that the existing circumstantial evidence makes it at least plausible that hard evidence for a genetic component will eventually be found. The first tests showing differences in IQ scores between different population groups in the United States were the tests of United States Army recruits in World War I. In the 1920s, groups of eugenics lobbyists argued that this demonstrated that African-Americans and certain immigrant groups were of inferior intellect to Anglo-Saxon white people, due to innate biological differences, using this as an argument for policies of racial segregation. However, soon, other studies appeared, contesting these conclusions and arguing instead that the Army tests had not adequately controlled for environmental factors, such as socio-economic and educational inequality between black people and white people. Later observations of phenomena such as the Flynn effect have also suggested that environmental factors play a greater role in group IQ differences than previously expected.  The causes of differences in IQ test scores are not well-understood, and the topic remains controversial among researchers.},

Results of a repeated cross-sectional study that collected individuals' perceptions of change one month prior to employee attitudes in consecutive years indicated that while the three change perceptions were moderately to strongly intercorrelated, the change perceptions displayed differential relationships with outcomes. Discussion focuses on the importance of systematically considering individuals' subjective experience of change.},

It is shown that, in regression, when there are many candidate independent variables, standard variable selection procedures can give very misleading results. Also, by selecting a single model, they ignore model uncertainty and so underestimate the uncertainty about quantities of interest. The Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing, model selection, and accounting for model uncertainty is presented. Implementing this is straightforward through the use of the simple and accurate BIC approximation, and it can be done using the output from standard software. Specific results are presented for most of the types of model commonly used in sociology. It is shown that this approach overcomes the difficulties with P-values and standard model selection procedures based on them. It also allows easy comparison of nonnested models, and permits the quantification of the evidence for a null hypothesis of interest, such as a convergence theory or a hypothesis about societal norms.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyse the relationship between patient satisfaction and background factors such as age, gender, health status and pain. In addition, to use background factors to create less biased ranking in comparisons of patient satisfaction between medical specialities. DESIGN: A questionnaire was sent by post to patients who had recently received inpatient care at a hospital within the County of Ostergötland, Sweden. The questionnaire contained 33 questions, 21 of which concerned the quality of health care and patient satisfaction. SETTING: Inpatient departments at all four hospitals in the County of Ostergötland, Sweden. SUBJECTS: All patients discharged from the hospital during a period of 6 weeks. Approximately 3400 patients aged 1-94 years responded to the questionnaire, resulting in a response rate of 69\%. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient satisfaction index score (PSI). RESULTS: Of the background factors tested, patient age had the greatest explanatory value regarding the PSI, closely followed by experiencing anxiety during admission. With regard to variations in the PSI, about 20\% could be explained by the background factors taken as a whole. Gender did not correlate with the PSI, although males were somewhat more satisfied than females. PSI scores differed among medical specialities and, interestingly, when age and other background factors were controlled for, the picture changed regarding the medical speciality that received the best PSI score. CONCLUSION: The change in ranking among medical specialities after adjustment for background factors emphasizes the importance of including background factors in patient satisfaction analyses in order to obtain less biased comparisons.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: . (i) To develop a reliable and valid scale to measure in-patient and outpatient perceptions of quality in India and (ii) to identify aspects of perceived quality which have large effects on patient satisfaction. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of health facilities and patients at clinics. SETTING: Primary health centers, community health centers, district hospitals, and female district hospitals in the state of Uttar Pradesh in north India. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Internal consistency, validity, and factor structure of the scale are evaluated. The association between patient satisfaction and perceived quality dimensions is examined. RESULTS: A 16-item scale having good reliability and validity is developed. Five dimensions of perceived quality are identified-medicine availability, medical information, staff behavior, doctor behavior, and hospital infrastructure. Patient perceptions of quality at public health facilities are slightly better than neutral. Multivariate regression analysis results indicate that for outpatients, doctor behavior has the largest effect on general patient satisfaction followed by medicine availability, hospital infrastructure, staff behavior, and medical information. For in-patients, staff behavior has the largest effect followed by doctor behavior, medicine availability, medical information, and hospital infrastructure. CONCLUSIONS: The scale developed can be used to measure perceived quality at a range of facility types for outpatients and in-patients. Perceived quality at public facilities is only marginally favorable, leaving much scope for improvement. Better staff and physician interpersonal skills, facility infrastructure, and availability of drugs have the largest effect in improving patient satisfaction at public health facilities.},

OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to validate this ICF Core Set from the perspective of nurses. METHOD Nurses experienced in RA treatment were asked about the patients' problems, patients' resources and aspects of environment that nurses take care of in a three-round survey using the Delphi technique. Responses were linked to the ICF. RESULTS 57 nurses in 15 countries named 1170 concepts that covered all ICF components. 20 concepts were linked to the as yet undeveloped ICF component Personal Factors. 19 ICF categories are not represented in the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for RA. CONCLUSION The validity of the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for RA was largely supported by the nurses. However, a number of body functions which address side effects of drug therapies were not included in the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for RA. Furthermore, several issues arose which were not precisely covered by the ICF like "dry mucous", "risk for decubitus ulcers" and "height" and need to be investigated further.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of an acute stretching intervention on knee extension range of motion, passive resistive torque and stiffness in subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee, and to compare these variables with subjects without osteoarthritis. DESIGN: Cross-sectional experimental study. SETTING: Human performance laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 55 participants were recruited: 28 subjects (males and females) with osteoarthritis of the knee joint and 27 subjects of a similar age without osteoarthritis of the knee joint. INTERVENTION: Using the Kincom dynamometer, three 60-second stretches with 60seconds of rest between stretches were applied to the hamstring muscle group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Peak knee extension range of motion, peak passive torque and stiffness in the final 10\% of knee extension range of motion. RESULTS: A significant (P{$<$}0.05) increase in knee extension range of motion, peak passive torque and stiffness was observed in both groups. For knee extension range of motion, the mean difference for the osteoarthritis group and non-osteoarthritis group was 4.9 degrees [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.9 to 8.5] and 4.4 degrees (95\% CI 1.8 to 6.8), respectively. For peak passive torque, the mean difference in the osteoarthritis group and the non-osteoarthritis group was 4.4Nm (95\% CI 0.8 to 6.9) and 1.0Nm (95\% CI -1.4 to 3.5), respectively. For stiffness in the final 10\% of knee extension range of motion, the mean difference for the osteoarthritis group and the non-osteoarthritis group was 0.19Nm/degree (95\% CI 0.08 to 0.3) and 0.04Nm/degree (95\% CI -0.05 to 0.1), respectively. Stiffness in the final 10\% of knee extension range of motion was significantly higher in the osteoarthritis group compared with the non-osteoarthritis group after stretching. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly individuals with and without osteoarthritis of the knee are able to demonstrate immediate beneficial adaptations to a stretching intervention. This is important as stretching is often used in preparation for exercise programmes.},

  abstract = {This article reviews the central nervous mechanisms involved in the broad network that generates and maintains REM sleep. Experimental investigations have identified the pontine tegmentum as the critical substrate for REM sleep mechanisms. Several pontine structures are involved in the generation of each particular polygraphic event that characterizes REM sleep: desynchronization in the electroencephalogram, theta rhythm in the hippocampus, muscle atonia, pontogeniculooccipital waves and rapid eye movements. The pontine tegmentum also holds the region where cholinergic stimulation can trigger all the behavioural and bioelectric signs of REM sleep. The exact location has been investigated and amply discussed over the last few years. Studies in the authors{$>$} laboratory, mapping the pontine tegmentum with small volume carbachol (a cholinergic agonist) microinjections, have demonstrated that the executive neurons for REM sleep generation are neither located in the dorsal part of the pontine tegmentum, nor diffusely spread through the medial pontine reticular formation: they are concentrated in a discrete area in the ventral part of the oral pontine reticular nucleus (vRPO). In turn, the vRPO has connections with structures involved in the generation of the other states of the sleep-wake cycle as well as with structures responsible for the generation of each of the different events characterizing REM sleep. This allows us to propose the vRPO as the crucial region for REM sleep generation. Related research, with invivo and invitro experiments, into the actions of different neurotransmitters on vRPO neurones indicates that not only acetylcholine but other neurotransmitters have an active key role in vRPO REM sleep generation mechanisms.},

The current version of SentiWS (v1.8b) contains 1,650 negative and 1,818 positive words, which sum up to 16,406 positive and 16,328 negative word forms, respectively. It not only contains adjectives and adverbs explicitly expressing a sentiment, but also nouns and verbs implicitly containing one. The present work describes the resource's structure, the three sources utilised to assemble it and the semi-supervised method incorporated to weight the strength of its entries. Furthermore the resource's contents are extensively evaluated using a German-language evaluation set we constructed. The evaluation set is verified being reliable and its shown that SentiWS provides a beneficial lexical resource for German-language sentiment analysis related tasks to build on.},

Focusing Ss on the injunctive norm suppressed littering regardless of whether the environment was clean or littered (Study 1) and regardless of whether the environment in which Ss could litter was the same as or different from that in which the norm was evoked (Studies 2 and 3). The impact of focusing Ss on the descriptive norm was much less general.

Systematic literature reviews, meta-analyses of published data, and meta-analyses of individual data (pooled reanalyses) are now being published with increasing frequency. We here describe the essential features of these methods and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.: This article is based on a selective literature search. The different types of review and meta-analysis are described, the methods used in each are outlined so that they can be evaluated, and a checklist is given for the assessment of reviews and meta-analyses of scientific articles.: Systematic literature reviews provide an overview of the state of research on a given topic and enable an assessment of the quality of individual studies. They also allow the results of different studies to be evaluated together when these are inconsistent. Meta-analyses additionally allow calculation of pooled estimates of an effect. The different types of review and meta-analysis are discussed with examples from the literature on one particular topic.: Systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses enable the research findings and treatment effects obtained in different individual studies to be summed up and evaluated.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: An important objective of epidemiological research is to identify risk factors for disease. Depending on the particular question being asked, cohort studies, case-control studies, or cross-sectional studies are conducted. METHODS: Methods of data analysis in different types of epidemiological studies are illustrated through examples with fictive data. Important measures of frequency and effect will be introduced. Different regression models will be presented as examples of complex analytical methods. RESULTS: Important frequency measures in cohort studies are incidence and mortality. Important effect measures such as the relative risk (RR), hazard ratio (HR), standardized incidence ratio (SIR), standardized mortality ratio (SMR), and odds ratio (OR) can also be calculated. In case-control or cross-sectional studies, the OR can be calculated as an effect measure. In cross-sectional studies, prevalence is the most important frequency measure. The interpretation of different frequency measures and effect measures will be discussed. CONCLUSION: The measures to be calculated and the analyses to be performed in an epidemiological study depend on the research questions being asked, the study type, and the available data.},

  abstract = {In the previous chapter, the variance was introduced as a measure of the dispersion of a univariate distribution. Additional statistics are required to describe the joint distribution of two or more variables. The covariance provides a natural measure of the association between two variables, and it appears in the analysis of many problems in quantitative genetics including the resemblance between relatives, the correlation between characters, and measures of selection. As a prelude to the formal theory of covariance and regression, we first pro- vide a brief review of the theory for the distribution of pairs of random variables. We then give a formal definition of the covariance and its properties. Next, we show how the covariance enters naturally into statistical methods for estimating the linear relationship between two variables (least-squares linear regression) and for estimating the goodness-of-fit of such linear trends (correlation). Finally, we apply the concept of covariance to several problems in quantitative-genetic the- ory. More advanced topics associated with multiv}

  abstract = {Exploratory data analysis is detective work--numerical detective work--or counting detective work--or graphical detective work. A detective investigating a crime needs both tools and under-standing. If he has no fingerprint powder, he will fail to find fingerprints on most surfaces. If he does not understand where the criminal is likely to have put his fingers, he will will not look in the right places. Equally, the analyst of data needs both tools and understanding (p 1: Tukey (1977)) As discussed in Chapter 1 the challenge of psychometrics is assign numbers to observations in a way that best summarizes the underlying constructs. The ways to collect observations are multiple and can be based upon comparisons of order or of proximity (Chapter 2). But given a set of observations, how best to describe them? This is a problem not just for observational but also for experimental psychologists for both approaches are attempting to make inferences about latent variables in terms of statistics based upon observed variables (Figure 3.1). For the experimentalist, the problem becomes interpreting the effect of an experimental manipulation upon some outcome variable (path B in Figure 3.1 in terms of the effect of manipulation on the latent outcome variable (path b) and the relationship between the latent and observed outcome variables (path s). For the observationalist, the observed correlation between the observed Person Variable and Outcome variable (path A) is interpreted as a function of the relationship between the latent person trait variable and the observed trait variable (path r), the latent outcome variable and the observed outcome variable (path s), and most importantly for inference, the relationship between the two latent variables (path a). Paths r and s are influenced by the reliability (Chapter 7), the validity (Chapter 9) and the shape of the functions r and s mapping the latents to the observed variables. The problem of measurement is a question about the shape of these relationships. But before it is possible to discuss shape it is necessary to consider the kinds of relationships that are possible. This requires a consideration of how to assign numbers to the data. Consider the set of observations organized into a data.frame, s.df, in Table 3.1. Copy this table into the clipboard, and read the clipboard into the data.frame, s.df. 1 A data.frame is an essential element in R and has many (but not all) the properties of a matrix. Unlike a matrix, the column entries can be of different data types (strings, logical, integer, or numeric). Data.frames have dimensions (the number of rows and columns), and a structure. To see the structure of a data.frame (or any other R object, use the str function. 1 Because  is read as X., we add the command colnames(s.df)[4] {$<$}-"theta" to match the table.}

A statistician often is facing with this problem: he has some observations of a quantitative character x1, x2, xn and he wishes to test if those observations, being a sample of an unknown population, belong from a population with a pdf (probability density function) f(x,), where  is a vector of parameters to estimate with available data. We can identify 4 steps in fitting distributions: 1) Model/function choice: hypothesize families of distributions; 2) Estimate parameters; 3) Evaluate quality of fit; 4) Goodness of fit statistical tests. This paper aims to face fitting distributions dealing shortly with theoretical issues and practical ones using the statistical environment and language R1. R is a language and an environment for statistical computing and graphics flexible and powerful. We are going to use some R statements concerning graphical techniques 2.0), model/function choice 3.0), parameters estimate 4.0), measures of goodness of fit 5.0) and most common goodness of fit tests 6.0).

The two units employed significantly differing procedural justice approaches. Lower procedural justice was predictive of higher burnout, strain, and turnover. The patterns of relationship were somewhat different for burnout and strain, implying that these two affective responses to change might be viewed as distinct from one another. Higher strain was predictive of turnover above and beyond contributions of procedural justice, supervision, and coping, but burnout was not. Implications for application and further research are discussed based on the research findings.},

We identify three high-leverage instructional practices for enculturatingmindfulness: looking closely, exploring possibilities and perspectives, and introducing ambiguity. We conclude by exploring what it might look like to cultivate the trait of mindfulness within individual classrooms. This report includes a review of an experimental study of `conditional instruction,' which explores mindfulness as a state, and then drawson a series of qualitative case studies of `thoughtful' classrooms to provide an example of conditional instruction as it might serve to develop a disposition of mindfulness.}

All three studies showed this effect to occur even though the person striving to bask in the glory of a successful source was not involved in the cause of the source's success. Experiment 1 demonstrated the BIRG phenome- non by showing a greater tendency for university students to wear school- identifying apparel after their school's football team had been victorious than nonvictorious. Experiments 2 and 3 replicated this effect by showing that stu- dents used the pronoun we more when describing a victory than a nonvictory of their school's football team. A model was developed asserting that the BIRG response represents an attempt to enhance one's public image. Experiments 2 and 3 indicated, in support of this assertion, that the tendency to proclaim a connection with a positive source was strongest when one's public image was threatened.},

In this article, we compare the predictive validity of personality traits with that of socioeconomic status (SES) and cognitive ability to test the relative contribution of personality traits to predictions of three critical outcomes: mortality, divorce, and occupational attainment. Only evidence from prospective longitudinal studies was considered. In addition, an attempt was made to limit the review to studies that controlled for important background factors. Results showed that the magnitude of the effects of personality traits on mortality, divorce, and occupational attainment was indistinguishable from the effects of SES and cognitive ability on these outcomes. These results demonstrate the influence of personality traits on important life outcomes, highlight the need to more routinely incorporate measures of personality into quality of life surveys, and encourage further research about the developmental origins of personality traits and the processes by which these traits influence diverse life outcomes.},

Tests enhance later retention more than additional study of the material, even when tests are given without feedback. This surpris- ing phenomenon is called the testing effect, and although it has been studied by cognitive psychologists sporadically over the years, today there is a renewed effort to learn why testing is effective and to apply testing in educational settings. In this article, we selectively review laboratory studies that reveal the power of testing in improving re- tention and then turn to studies that demonstrate the basic effects in educational settings. We also consider the related concepts of dynamic testing and formative assess- ment as other means of using tests to improve learning. Finally,we consider some negative consequences of testing that may occur in certain circumstances, though these negative effects are often small and do not cancel out the large positive effects of testing. Frequent testing in the classroom may boost educational achievement at all levels of education.},

(3) The second person, whom we shall term the therapist, is congruent or integrated in the relationship. (4) The therapist experiences unconditional positive regard for the client. (5) The therapist experiences an empathic understanding of the client's internal frame of reference and endeavors to communicate this experience to the client.

We implemented an ICNP browser and we integrated it into two different systems: the nursing electronic patient record and the nursing protocols editor. The former allows nurses to choose ICNP terms for filling the clinical chart, while the latter allows computerising protocols using ICNP terms for the actions specification. Since, in a nursing information system, it should be worth to integrate protocols with the electronic patient record, sharing the same terminology is a crucial issue. We also show how we tailored the information system to the different wards. For each ward, we devised the most frequent patient needs and nursing actions. These lists are used to customise the different interfaces. Finally, by testing the prototype using real-world documents (clinical charts and protocols), we carried out an evaluation of the terminology itself, about its completeness and usability.},

  abstract = {Correlation does not imply causation; but often, observational data are the only option, even though the research question at hand involves causality. This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables—colliders and mediators—should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.},

METHODS: This article describes the structured classification of studies into two types, primary and secondary, as well as a further subclassification of studies of primary type. This is done on the basis of a selective literature search concerning study types in medical research, in addition to the authors' own experience. RESULTS: Three main areas of medical research can be distinguished by study type: basic (experimental), clinical, and epidemiological research. Furthermore, clinical and epidemiological studies can be further subclassified as either interventional or noninterventional. CONCLUSIONS: The study type that can best answer the particular research question at hand must be determined not only on a purely scientific basis, but also in view of the available financial resources, staffing, and practical feasibility (organization, medical prerequisites, number of patients, etc.).},

One hundred and ninety-one older persons dependent in activities of daily living, living in residential care facilities, and with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of ? 10 participated. They were randomised to a high-intensity functional exercise program or a control activity, which included 29 sessions over 3 months, as well as to protein-enriched energy supplement or placebo. Berg Balance Scale, self-paced and maximum gait speed, and one-repetition maximum in lower-limb strength were followed-up at three and six months and analysed by 2 x 2 factorial ANCOVA, using the intention-to-treat principle. At three months, the exercise group had improved significantly in self-paced gait speed compared with the control group (mean difference 0.04 m/s, p = 0.02). At six months, there were significant improvements favouring the exercise group for Berg Balance Scale (1.9 points, p = 0.05), self-paced gait speed (0.05 m/s, p = 0.009), and lower-limb strength (10.8 kg, p = 0.03). No interaction effects were seen between the exercise and nutrition interventions. In conclusion, a high-intensity functional exercise program has positive long-term effects in balance, gait ability, and lower-limb strength for older persons dependent in activities of daily living. An intake of protein-enriched energy supplement immediately after the exercises does not appear to increase the effects of the training.},

This retrospective cohort study with independent development and testing phases was conducted at a U.S. academic medical center. In the development phase, data regarding 14,183 adult medical-surgical patients admitted to the medical center in 1985 and 1986 was used. In the testing phase, data regarding 7,302 patients admitted in 1987 and 1988 was used. Primary nurses prospectively recorded the presence or absence of 61 nursing diagnoses on admission. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from hospital data bases. In the development phase, the number of admission nursing diagnoses was highly related (P {$<$} 0.001) to in-hospital mortality. Using multiple logistic regression, 34 nursing diagnoses were identified as independent predictors of mortality; the Nursing Severity Index equals the number of these 34 diagnoses. In the testing phase of 7,302 patients, the Nursing Severity Index was related (P {$<$} 0.001) to mortality rates, which were 0.5\%, 1\%, 2\%, 6\%, 13\%, 22\%, and 31\% in seven hierarchical strata defined by the Index. The Index was as accurate in predicting mortality as MedisGroups (receiver-operating-characteristic curve areas, 0.814 ± 0.016 vs. 0.845 ± 0.015, respectively, P = 0.12). Furthermore, the Nursing Severity Index and MedisGroups together (receiver operating caracteristic curve area 0.880 ± 0.014), were more accurate (P {$<$} 0.01) than either measure alone. The Nursing Severity Index assesses multiple dimensions of illness, can be easily measured during rutine patient care, accurately predicts the risk of in-hospital death, and has similar prognostic accuracy as MedisGroups. Its usefulness in outcomes assessment, quality assurance, and case management merits further study.}

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the representation of health asset concepts in the International Classification of Nursing Practice (ICNP). In a previous study we conducted a concept analysis of health assets, building a conceptual model. The terms included in our conceptual model were cross-mapped to the ICNP terminology system, Version 1.0/1.1. Most of the health asset terms in the conceptual model were represented in ICNP. However, for maximum support of both clinical nursing care and patient self-care, a complete set of health asset terms is needed in the ICNP. We advocate for more research to uncover patients' and clinicians' detailed use of health asset terms. This should result in a richer and more specific health assets vocabulary that could be integrated into ICNP or other nursing terminologies as a means to improve nursing care and to strengthen patients' self-management of their illnesses. However, the findings from this first evaluation of health asset terms in the ICNP are promising, at least on a global level.},

Five measures of situational interest were administered at critical points in time to 69 polytechnic students during a one-day, problem-based learning session. Results revealed that situational interest significantly increased after the problem stimulus was presented. Subsequently, situational interest gradually decreased but at the end of the day increased again. Testing a path model relating the situational interest measures showed strong (directional) interrelations. Moreover, situational interest was highly predictive for observed achievement-related classroom behaviors. The latter, in turn, proved to be a significant predictor of academic achievement. Aggregating situational interest over the day led to less accurate predictions of achievement-related classroom behaviors and academic achievement. Implications of these findings for situational interest research are discussed. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

Using confirmatory factor analysis, one- and two-dimensional models were tested. Results suggest that the RSES is a two-dimensional scale comprising the highly correlated components positive and negative self-evaluation, which constitute a unitary construct of global self-esteem at the second-order level. In order to obtain a more conclusive solution, an item response theory (IRT) analysis (partial credit model) was conducted. Results lend support to a one-dimensional view of the RSES. Furthermore, psychometric properties and norm values based on the representative sample are reported. Analyses revealed extremely high response probabilities for all items, as a consequence of which self-esteem cannot be differentiated at the upper end of the range.}

  abstract = {The percentile bootstrap is the Swiss Army Knife of statistics: it is a non-parametric method based on data-driven simulations. It can be applied to many statistical problems, as a substitute to standard parametric approaches, or in situations where parametric methods do not exist. In this tutorial, we cover R code to implement the percentile bootstrap in a few situations: one-sample estimation and the comparison of two independent groups for measures of central tendency (means and trimmed means) and spread. For each example, we explain how to derive a bootstrap distribution, and how to get a confidence interval and a p value from that distribution. We also demonstrate how to run a simulation to assess the behaviour of the bootstrap. In some situations, the bootstrap performs poorly, such as when making inferences about the mean. But for other purposes, it is the only known method that works well over a broad range of situations, such as when comparing medians and there are tied (duplicated) values. More broadly, combining the percentile bootstrap with robust estimators, i.e. estimators that are not overly sensitive to outliers, the bootstrap can help users gain a deeper understanding of their data, relative to conventional methods.}

When combined with robust estimators, the bootstrap can afford much more powerful and flexible inferences than is possible with standard approaches such as t-tests on means. In this R tutorial, we use detailed illustrations of bootstrap simulations to give readers an intuition of what the bootstrap does and how it can be applied to solve many practical problems, such as building confidence intervals for many aspects of the data. In particular, we illustrate how to build confidence intervals for measures of location, including measures of central tendency, in the one-sample case, for two independent and two dependent groups. We also demonstrate how to compare correlation coefficients using the bootstrap and to perform simulations to determine if the bootstrap is fit for purpose for a particular application. The tutorial also addresses two widespread misconceptions about the bootstrap: that it makes no assumptions about the data, and that it leads to robust inferences on its own. The tutorial focuses on detailed graphical descriptions, with data and code available online to reproduce the figures and analyses in the article (https://osf.io/8b4t5/).}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a leading health threat. Determination of optimal therapies for long-term weight loss remains a challenge. Evidence suggests that successful weight loss depends on the compliance of weight loss program participants with their weight loss efforts. Despite this, little is known regarding the attributes influencing such compliance. The purpose of this study was to assess, using a discrete choice experiment (DCE), the relative importance of weight loss program attributes to its participants and to express these preferences in terms of their willingness to pay for them. RESEARCH METHODS: A DCE survey explored the following weight loss program attributes in a sample of 165 overweight adults enrolled in community weight loss programs: cost, travel time required to attend, extent of physician involvement (e.g., none, monthly, every 2 weeks), components (e.g., diet, exercise, behavior change) emphasized, and focus (e.g., group, individual). The rate at which participants were willing to trade among attributes and the willingness to pay for different configurations of combined attributes were estimated using regression modeling. RESULTS: All attributes investigated appeared to be statistically significant. The most important unit change was "program components emphasized" (e.g., moving from diet only to diet and exercise). DISCUSSION: The majority of participants were willing to pay for weight loss programs that reflected their preferences. The DCE tool was useful in quantifying and understanding individual preferences in obesity management and provided information that could help to maximize the efficiency of existing weight loss programs or the design of new programs.},

Although outcome measures of quality represent the desired end results of health care, validated process of care measures provide an important additional element to quality improvement efforts, as they illuminate exactly which provider actions could be changed to improve patient outcomes. In this essay, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of process measures of quality, and outline some practical strategies and issues in implementing them.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Traditionally, nursing care has been described as performing nursing tasks and often focused on nurses carrying out doctors' orders. In many countries of the world, including Pakistan, nurses do not document care in a standardized manner. Because of this limitation many health administrators, policy makers, and consumers make inadequate assumptions about nursing work, often regarding nurses as any other 'health care technician' who can be easily replaced by more economical health care workers. PURPOSE To overcome this problem, standardized documentation is being introduced into the Aga Khan University School of Nursing and hospital, Aga Khan Health Services, Public Health School in Karachi, and government colleges of nursing, using the International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP). The purpose of this paper is to highlight the process of introducing and developing standardized nursing care plans (NCP) using ICNP in Pakistan. PROCESS The process for introducing ICNP consists of four components, including administrative planning, development, teaching and training, and testing. Subsets of the ICNP for (i) maternity: antenatal, postnatal and natal care; and (ii) cardiology were developed using standardized NCPs. The subsets were developed by nurse experts and introduced at the testing sites. The testing will be conducted as a pilot project. Findings from the pilot will be used to continue and expand standardized nursing documentation using the ICNP across Pakistan. CONCLUSION Through this project, nurses, midwives and lady health visitors (midwives, vaccinator and health educators) will test standardization of documentation and begin to evaluate efficiency and effectiveness of clinical practice.},

  abstract = {The detrimental effects of stress on human health are being increasingly recognized. There is a critical need for the establishment of a biomarker that accurately measures its intensity and course over time. Such a biomarker would allow monitoring of stress, increase understanding of its pathophysiology and may help identify appropriate and successful management strategies. Whereas saliva and urine cortisol capture real-time levels, hair cortisol analysis presents a complementary means of monitoring stress, capturing systemic cortisol exposure over longer periods of time. This novel approach for cortisol quantification is being increasingly used to identify the effects of stress in a variety of pathological situations, from chronic pain to acute myocardial infarctions. Because of its ability to provide a long-term, month-by-month measure of systemic cortisol exposure, hair cortisol analysis is becoming a useful tool, capable of answering clinical questions that could previously not be answered by other tests. In this paper we review the development, current status, limitations and outstanding questions regarding the use of hair cortisol as a biomarker of chronic stress.},

Accordingly, research guided by self-determination theory has focused on the social-contextual conditions that facilitate versus forestall the natural processes of self-motivation and healthy psychological development. Specifically, factors have been examined that enhance versus undermine intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and well-being. The findings have led to the postulate of three innate psychological needs--competence, autonomy, and relatedness--which when satisfied yield enhanced self-motivation and mental health and when thwarted lead to diminished motivation and well-being. Also considered is the significance of these psychological needs and processes within domains such as health care, education, work, sport, religion, and psychotherapy.},

  abstract = {The unprecedented popularity of the social networking site Facebook raises a number of important questions regarding the impact it has on sociality. However, as Facebook is a very recent social phenomenon, there is a distinct lack of psychological theory relating to its use. While research has begun to identify the types of people who use Facebook, this line of investigation has been limited to student populations. The current study aimed to investigate how personality influences usage or non-usage of Facebook. The sample consisted of 1324 self-selected Australian Internet users (1158 Facebook users and 166 Facebook nonusers), between the ages of 18 and 44. Participants were required to complete an online questionnaire package comprising the Big Five Inventory (BFI), the Narcissistic Personality Inventory - 29-item version (NPI-29), the Revised Cheek and Buss Shyness Scale (RCBS), and the Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults - Short version (SELSA-S). Facebook users also completed a Facebook usage questionnaire. The results showed that Facebook users tend to be more extraverted and narcissistic, but less conscientious and socially lonely, than nonusers. Furthermore, frequency of Facebook use and preferences for specific features were also shown to vary as a result of certain characteristics, such as neuroticism, loneliness, shyness and narcissism. It is hoped that research in this area continues, and leads to the development of theory regarding the implications and gratifications of Facebook use. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This review summarizes the empirical data on the validity of actigraphy in assessing sleep-wake patterns and assessing clinical and control groups ranging in age from infancy to elderly. An overview of sleep-related actigraphic studies is also included. Actigraphy provides useful measures of sleep-wake schedule and sleep quality. The data also suggest that actigraphy, despite its limitations, may be a useful, cost-effective method for assessing specific sleep disorders, such as insomnia and schedule disorders, and for monitoring their treatment process. Methodological issues such as the proper use of actigraphy and possible artifacts have not been systematically addressed in clinical research and practice.},

The objective was to develop and analyse the psychometric properties of a new composite disease-specific index (Fibromyalgia Assessment Status, FAS), a simple self-administered index that combines a patient's assessment of fatigue, sleep disturbances and pain evaluated on the basis of the 16 non-articular sites listed on the Self-Assessment Pain Scale (SAPS) in a single measure (range 0 to 10).{$<$}/AbstractText{$>$} {$<$}AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS"{$>$}The FAS index was constructed using a traditional development strategy, and its psychometric properties were tested in 226 FM patients (209 women, 17 men); whose disease-related characteristics were assessed by means of an 11-numbered circular numerical rating scale (NRS) for pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances and general health (GH), the tender point score (TPS), the SAPS, the FIQ, and the SF-36. A group of 226 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients was used for comparative purposes. Of the 179 FM patients who entered the follow-up study, 152 completed the three-month period and were included in the responsiveness analyses. One hundred and fifty-four patients repeated the FAS questionnaire after an interval of one week, and its test/re-test reliability was calculated. Responsiveness was evaluated on the basis of effect size and the standardised response mean.{$<$}/AbstractText{$>$} {$<$}AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS"{$>$}The FAS index fulfilled the established criteria for validity, reliability and responsiveness. Factor analysis showed that SAPS and fatigue contributed most, and respectively explained 47.4\% and 31.2\% of the variance; sleep explained 21.3\%. Testing for internal consistency showed that Cronbach's alpha was 0.781, thus indicating a high level of reliability. As expected, closer significant correlations were found when FAS was compared with total FIQ (rho = 0.347; P {$<$} 0.0001) and the FIQ subscales, particularly job ability, tiredness, fatigue and pain (all P {$<$} 0.0001), but the correlation between FAS and the mental component summary scale score (MCS) of the SF-36 (rho = -0.531; P {$<$} 0.0001) was particularly interesting. Test/re-test reliability was satisfactory. The FAS showed the greatest effect size. The magnitude of the responsiveness measures was statistically different between FAS (0.889) and the FIQ (0.781) (P = 0.038), and between the SF-36 MCS (0.434) and the SF-36 physical component summary scale score (PCS) (0.321) (P {$<$} 0.01).{$<$}/AbstractText{$>$} {$<$}AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS"{$>$}The self-administered FAS is a reliable, valid and responsive disease-specific composite measure for assessing treatment effect in patients with FM.{$<$}/AbstractText{$>$}},

  abstract = {How predictable are life trajectories? We investigated this question with a scientific mass collaboration using the common task method; 160 teams built predictive models for six life outcomes using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a high-quality birth cohort study. Despite using a rich dataset and applying machine-learning methods optimized for prediction, the best predictions were not very accurate and were only slightly better than those from a simple benchmark model. Within each outcome, prediction error was strongly associated with the family being predicted and weakly associated with the technique used to generate the prediction. Overall, these results suggest practical limits to the predictability of life outcomes in some settings and illustrate the value of mass collaborations in the social sciences.},

  abstract = {Measures of psychological attributes abound in the social sciences as much as measures of physical properties do in the physical sciences. However, there are crucial differences between the scientific underpinning of measurement. While measurement in the physical sciences is supported by empirical evidence that demonstrates the quantitative nature of the property assessed, measurement in the social sciences is, in large part, made possible only by a vague, discretionary definition of measurement that places hardly any restrictions on empirical data. Traditional psychometric analyses fail to address the requirements of measurement as defined more rigorously in the physical sciences. The construct definitions do not allow for testable predictions; and content validity becomes a matter of highly subjective judgment. In order to improve measurement of psychological attributes, it is suggested to, first, readopt the definition of measurement in the physical sciences; second, to devise an elaborate theory of the construct to be measured that includes the hypothesis of a quantitative attribute; and third, to test the data for the structure implied by the hypothesis of quantity as well as predictions derived from the theory of the construct.},

  abstract = {AIM: This paper offers a discussion of the reading and writing practices that define systematic review. BACKGROUND: Although increasingly popular, systematic review has engendered a critique of the claims made for it as a more objective method for summing up research findings than other kinds of reviews. DISCUSSION: An alternative understanding of systematic review is as a highly subjective, albeit disciplined, engagement between resisting readers and resistant texts. Reviewers of research exemplify the resisting reader when they exclude reports on grounds of relevance, quality, or methodological difference. Research reports exemplify resistant texts as they do not simply yield their findings, but rather must be made docile to review. These acts of resistance make systematic review possible, but challenge claims of its greater capacity to control bias. CONCLUSION: An understanding of the reading and writing practices that define systematic review still holds truth and objectivity as regulative ideals, but is aware of the reading and writing practices that both enable and challenge those ideals.},

ICNP is also the reason why the Italian association Consociazione, representing Italian Nurses at ICN, through the School of Advanced Nursing of the University 'La Sapienza' of Rome, has set up a working group for the translation and experimentation of the ICNP version Beta 2. CONTENT In this article the ICNP beta translation and validation into Italian is considered with some scenarios of how benefit could be derived by its utilization for nursing's visibility. The visibility of nursing care can be measured not only through patient outcomes but also by studying the existing data of patient care documentation. To have a common language and terminology in nursing is important for a universal understanding. RESULTS Some philosophical reasoning on the genesis and development of ICNP is discussed along with arguments for and against nursing classification systems. Some findings on Italian experimentation for nursing documentation as well as economical analysis are reported along with a vision for future development and utilization.},

A popular method to perform the user acceptance testing is the usability testing, which in this method, the result provides the indication of the essential quality for the client to decide whether to approve or to deny the product. In this research of paper, we are going to do the usability testing by utilizing the System Usability Scale technique and the Net Promoter Score technique to measure appropriateness of the population information systems in the city of Tegal while we are also finding optimum testers required using the sampling technique. The result we earn trough this research is according to the Usability Testing result the proposed system developed by researchers is better than the current running system and the total testers participating on system testing is able to optimize using the sampling method.},

  abstract = {Some psychologists treat religious/spiritual beliefs as a unitary aspect of individual differences. But a distinction between mysticism and orthodox religion has been recognized by scholars as well as laypersons, and empirical studies of "ism" variables and of "spirituality" measures have yielded factors reflecting this distinction. Using a large sample of American adults, analyses demonstrate that subjective spirituality and tradition-oriented religiousness are empirically highly independent and have distinctly different correlates in the personality domain, suggesting that individuals with different dispositions tend toward different styles of religious/spiritual beliefs. These dimensions have low correlations with the lexical Big Five but high correlations with scales (e.g., Absorption, Traditionalism) on some omnibus personality inventories, indicating their relevance for studies of personality.},

  abstract = {Depression is one of the most clinically relevant mood disorders, and many assessment instruments have been developed to measure it. Probably the most frequently used instrument is Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). The simplified BDI (BDI-S) is a more efficient version of the BDI that has been shown to be no less reliable or valid. As the BDI-S has not yet been subjected to rigorous tests of Item Response Theory, it is the aim of the present paper to conduct such an analysis using the Rasch model. This study subjected a simplified version of the BDI consisting of 20 items (BDI-S20) to a Rasch analysis in a sample of N=5,035 participants. The scale, minus one misfitting item (BDI-S19), yielded a good approximation to Rasch assumptions. Moderate differential item functioning (DIF) was present. It is concluded that the BDI-S19 is an internally valid instrument for assessing depression, although some room for improvement exists.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The findings of epidemiological studies, diagnostic tests, and comparative therapeutic trials are often presented in 2 x 2 tables. These must be interpreted correctly for a proper understanding of the findings. METHODS: The authors present basic statistical concepts required for the analysis of nominal data, referring to standard works in statistics. RESULTS: The relative risk and odds ratio are defined to be indices for the relationship between two binary quantities (e.g., exposure--yes/no and disease--yes/no). The topics dealt with in this article include the effect of sample size on the length of the confidence interval and the p-value, and also inaccuracies caused by measuring error. Exposures are often expressed on a three-level scale (none, low, high). The authors also consider the 2 x 3 table as an extension of the 2 x 2 table and discuss the categorization of continuous measurements. Typically, more than one factor is involved in the development of a disease. The effect that a further factor can have on the observed relationship between the exposure and the disease is discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Sample size, measurement error, categorization, and confounders influence the statistical interpretation of 2 x 2 tables in many ways. Readers of scientific publications should know the inherent problems in the interpretation of simple 2 x 2 tables and check that the authors have taken these into account adequately in analyzing and interpreting their data.},

  abstract = {The objective of the study was to test whether Gray's " Behavioural Inhibition System" (BIS) is a pathway from mindfulness towards well-being in a cross-sectional and correlational design, using online data collection. We administered the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI) and the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills (KIMS) to a non-clinical sample of German adults (n= 211). BIS was measured using the Action Regulation Emotion System Questionnaire (ARES), and well-being was measured using a compound variable consisting of the Marburg Habitual Well-being Scale (MHW) along with two subscales of the Questionnaire of General Habitual Well-Being (FAHW). We analysed two mediator models with the FMI or KIMS as independent variables, respectively. In both models, BIS was modelled as a mediator, and well-being served as the dependent variable. The total effect of mindfulness on well-being was found to be strong for both models. Also, the effect of mindfulness on the proposed mediator BIS was substantial, as was the effect of BIS on well-being. The study demonstrates that BIS can partially explain the pathway between mindfulness and well-being, suggesting that BIS may be a mediator of the effects of mindfulness. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {User experience (UX) summarizes user perceptions and responses resulting from the interaction with a product, system, or service. The User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) is one standardized instrument for measuring UX. With six scales, it identifies areas in which product improvements will have the highest impact. In this paper, we evaluate the reliability and validity of this questionnaire. The data of N = 1, 121 participants who interacted with one of 23 products indicated an acceptable to good reliability of all scales. The results show, however, that the scales were not independent of each other. Combining perspicuity, efficiency, and dependability to pragmatic aspects as well as novelty and stimulation to hedonic aspects of UX improved the model fit significantly. The systematic variations of product properties and correlations with the System Usability Scale (SUS) in a second experiment with N=499 participants supported the validity of these two factors. Practical implications of the results are discussed.},

Mithilfe solcher Theorien soll unter wissenschaftlichen Gesichtspunkten Arbeitsverhalten bzw. --handeln beschrieben, erklärt und vorhergesagt werden. Unter eher praktischen bzw. anwendungsbezogenen Aspekten sollten gemäß Hacker (2006) solche Theorien auch in der Lage sein, zum einen Erkenntnisse zur Verbesserung von Arbeitsaufgaben und ihren Ausführungsbedingungen zu liefern und zum anderen Erkenntnisse zur Verbesserung von Leistungsvoraussetzungen arbeitender Menschen abzuleiten. Im Verlauf der historischen Entwicklung der Arbeits- und Organisationspsychologie wurden -- auch unter dem Einfluss jeweils dominierender disziplinärer und zeitgeschichtlicher Theorieströmungen -- ganz unterschiedliche theoretische Ansätze zur Beschreibung, Erklärung und Vorhersage von Arbeitsverhalten bzw. -handeln entwickelt. Im Rahmen dieses Lehrbuchs können daher nur Schlaglichter auf diese Entwicklung geworfen werden. Im Folgenden werden vier bedeutsame theoretische Ansätze des Arbeitshandelns betrachtet und vorgestellt: Verhaltens- und lerntheoretische Ansätze, kognitionspsychologische Ansätze, sowie handlungs- und tätigkeitstheoretische Ansätze. Dabei sollen folgende Fragen beantwortet werden: Auf welchen Grundannahmen beruht der jeweilige Ansatz? Welche grundlegenden Erklärungskonzepte wurden jeweils zur Beschreibung und Erklärung von Arbeitsverhalten entwickelt? Welche Anwendungsbezüge und praktischen Konzepte ergeben sich aus diesen Theorien?},

  abstract = {The Survey of Attitudes Toward Statistics (SATS) was designed for use in both research and instruction. A panel of instructors and introductory statistics students identified by consensus four facets of attitudes toward statistics: (a) Affect-positive and negative feelings concerning statistics; (b) Cognitive Competence-attitudes about intellectual knowledge and skills when applied to statistics; (c) Value-attitudes about the usefulness, relevance, and worth of statistics; and (d) Difficulty-attitudes about the difficulty of statistics as a subject. This structure was validated for a sample of undergraduate students using confirmatory factor analysis. Additional validity evidence was obtained through the correlation of the SATS with Wise's Attitudes Toward Statistics scale, which showed significant, positive relationships between the two instruments.}

  abstract = {Acceptance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) may be predicted by individual psychological correlates, examined here. Study 1 reports confirmatory validation of the General Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS) following initial validation elsewhere. Confirmatory Factor Analysis confirmed the two-factor structure (Positive, Negative) and showed good convergent and divergent validity with a related scale. Study 2 tested whether psychological factors (Big Five personality traits, corporate distrust, and general trust) predicted attitudes towards AI. Introverts had more positive attitudes towards AI overall, likely because of algorithm appreciation. Conscientiousness and agreeableness were associated with forgiving attitudes towards negative aspects of AI. Higher corporate distrust led to negative attitudes towards AI overall, while higher general trust led to positive views of the benefits of AI. The dissociation between general trust and corporate distrust may reflect the public’s attributions of the benefits and drawbacks of AI. Results are discussed in relation to theory and prior findings.}

  abstract = {A new General Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS) was developed. The scale underwent initial statistical validation via Exploratory Factor Analysis, which identified positive and negative subscales. Both subscales captured emotions in line with their valence. In addition, the positive subscale reflected societal and personal utility, whereas the negative subscale reflected concerns. The scale showed good psychometric indices and convergent and discriminant validity against existing measures. To cross-validate general attitudes with attitudes towards specific instances of AI applications, summaries of tasks accomplished by specific applications of Artificial Intelligence were sourced from newspaper articles. These were rated for comfortableness and perceived capability. Comfortableness with specific applications was a strong predictor of general attitudes as measured by the GAAIS, but perceived capability was a weaker predictor. Participants viewed AI applications involving big data (e.g. astronomy, law, pharmacology) positively, but viewed applications for tasks involving human judgement, (e.g. medical treatment, psychological counselling) negatively. Applications with a strong ethical dimension led to stronger discomfort than their rated capabilities would predict. The survey data suggested that people held mixed views of AI. The initially validated two-factor GAAIS to measure General Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence is included in the Appendix.},

  abstract = {Nursing diagnoses represent individual reactions to existing or potential changes in one's state of health. They are result of a diagnostic process, which is part of the dynamic nursing care process in its whole. Thus, as a basis of nursing interventions diagnoses have to be proved continuously. The classification of the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) as well as the International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP) can be account to the international well-known classifications of nursing diagnoses. Comparing their structures, some fundamental differences between both classifications become obvious. While the NANDA classification represents a systematic structured body of nursing knowledge with regard to human health reactions patterns, the ICNP reflects a more comprehensive part of the nursing reality, since it also contains nursing interventions and outcomes. Until the latest changes by establishing the taxonomy II, NANDA diagnoses have primarily focused deficits. But in contrast to the diagnoses of the ICNP they also comprise etiological factors. To prove the applicability of both classifications to nursing practice, they have been applied to a case study of a female resident living in a nursing home. The results of analysis show that because of their different structures the NANDA classification and ICNP have their own possibilities and limitations in covering the resident's individual needs of nursing care. These characteristic potentials and restrictions have to be taken into account when one of the classification systems is going to be implemented into nursing practice.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the role of the health care professional in creating an optimal healing environment (OHE), with a special focus on which inner state and way of being in the world can create a healing intention. A core thesis is that every healing effort and every healing intention starts within the health care professional. An accepting, mindful, and warm-hearted relationship with self is primary to any healing intention. Important concepts to develop such an attitude are mindfulness, love, compassion, and awareness. The concept of a healing attitude toward the self is described, as is the mirror principle that states there is symmetry between someone's relationship with the outer world and his or her inner world. The mindfulness concept is outlined through a set of mental and heart qualities. Mindfulness is strongly related to compassion, and it is compassion that serves as a source for all healing intentionality. Compassion connects the suffering of the patient with the healer's own suffering, and this emotional connection instantiates a healing relationship. The power and importance of mindfulness and compassion for healing are explored along the Frank model of nonspecific therapeutic components. This is the approach whereby a health care professional can elicit self-healing powers in patients through his or her inner attitudes. Finally, a research program and some hypotheses on how to implement and research this specific approach toward the creation of an OHE are outlined.},

  abstract = {This study examined whether the individual capacity for self-control (as a psychological resource) moderates (i.e., buffers) the adverse influences of self-control demands (as a psychological work stressor) on employees' perceived job strain and well-being. To our knowledge this relationship has not previously been studied. In line with the match principle proposed by de Jonge and Dormann (2006), it was assumed that this moderator effect was most likely to emerge in psychological outcomes, whereas physical outcomes were expected to reflect no equivalent relationships. Data collected from 249 health care workers employed in an area of Eastern Germany confirmed both hypotheses. Psychological outcomes (such as emotional exhaustion, depressive symptoms and sleep disorders) clearly indicated that the detrimental impacts of self-control demands are attenuated with an increase in self-control capacity. By way of contrast, musculoskeletal complaints as a physical outcome, which was mainly included as a control variable, failed to reflect any effects of both predictors. Our findings draw attention to the importance of improving the match between self-control demands and self-control capacity of service employees in order to make self-control demands less stressful.},

In the adult sample, belief in a just world covaried with gender, age, origin (East-Germany, West-Germany), marital status, education, and employment. Origin and education had the largest effects. Therefore, origin- and education specific norms were determined in addition to general norms. Age and gender differences were small in the student sample. Type of school (elementary, middle, high) and grade (5[sup]th[/sup]/6[sup]th[/sup] grade, 7[sup]th[/sup]/8[sup]th[/sup] grade, 9[sup]th[/sup]/10[sup]th[/sup] grade, 11[sup]th[/sup]/12[sup]th[/sup]/13[sup]th[/sup] grade) determined 9\% and 12\% of the belief in a just world variance, respectively. Therefore, school type and grade specific norms were obtained in addition to general norms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

  abstract = {Albert Einstein (* 14. März 1879 in Ulm, Württemberg, Deutsches Reich; † 18. April 1955 in Princeton, New Jersey, Vereinigte Staaten) war ein deutscher Physiker mit Schweizer und US-amerikanischer Staatsbürgerschaft. Er gilt als einer der bedeutendsten theoretischen Physiker der Wissenschaftsgeschichte und weltweit als bekanntester Wissenschaftler der Neuzeit. Seine Forschungen zur Struktur von Materie, Raum und Zeit sowie zum Wesen der Gravitation veränderten maßgeblich das zuvor geltende newtonsche Weltbild. Einsteins Hauptwerk, die Relativitätstheorie, machte ihn weltberühmt. Im Jahr 1905 erschien seine Arbeit mit dem Titel Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper, deren Inhalt heute als spezielle Relativitätstheorie bezeichnet wird. 1915 publizierte er die allgemeine Relativitätstheorie. Auch zur Quantenphysik leistete er wesentliche Beiträge. „Für seine Verdienste um die theoretische Physik, besonders für seine Entdeckung des Gesetzes des photoelektrischen Effekts“, erhielt er den Nobelpreis des Jahres 1921, der ihm 1922 überreicht wurde. Seine theoretischen Arbeiten spielten – im Gegensatz zur weit verbreiteten Meinung – beim Bau der Atombombe und der Entwicklung der Kernenergie nur eine indirekte Rolle.Albert Einstein gilt als Inbegriff des Forschers und Genies. Er nutzte seine außerordentliche Bekanntheit auch außerhalb der naturwissenschaftlichen Fachwelt bei seinem Einsatz für Völkerverständigung und Frieden. Im Laufe seines Lebens war Einstein Staatsbürger mehrerer Länder: Durch Geburt besaß er die württembergische Staatsbürgerschaft. Von 1896 bis 1901 staatenlos, ab 1901 bis zu seinem Tode Staatsbürger der Schweiz, war er 1911/1912 in Österreich-Ungarn auch Bürger Österreichs. Von 1914 bis 1932 lebte Einstein in Berlin und war als Bürger Preußens erneut Staatsangehöriger im Deutschen Reich. Mit der Machtergreifung Hitlers gab er 1933 den deutschen Pass endgültig ab und wurde 1934 vom Deutschen Reich strafausgebürgert. Zusätzlich zu seinem Schweizer Bürgerrecht erwarb er 1940 noch die Staatsbürgerschaft der Vereinigten Staaten.},

In this report we use Monte-Carlo simulations to determine the critical sample size from which on the magnitude of a correlation can be expected to be stable. The necessary sample size to achieve stable estimates for correlations depends on the effect size, the width of the corridor of stability (i.e., a corridor around the true value where deviations are tolerated), and the requested confidence that the trajectory does not leave this corridor any more. Results indicate that in typical scenarios the sample size should approach 250 for stable estimates. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

These cohort effects are calculated after controlling for age and period effects using upwards of 500,000 observations from more than 70,000 individuals in the German Socio-Economic Panel study. They show that differences, which the literature postulates between the so-called generation Y, X, the baby boomers, the generation of 68, and the so-called skeptical post-war generation hardly exist. This means that surveys such as the Shell Youth Study make little sense, as does a management literature that gives advice on how to handle generational differences that are not empirically identifiable.},

  abstract = {Initiating and maintaining behavior change is key to the prevention and treatment of most preventable chronic medical and psychiatric illnesses. The cultivation of mindfulness, involving acceptance and nonjudgment of present-moment experience, often results in transformative health behavior change. Neural systems involved in motivation and learning have an important role to play. A theoretical model of mindfulness that integrates these mechanisms with the cognitive, emotional, and self-related processes commonly described, while applying an integrated model to health behavior change, is needed. This integrative review (1) defines mindfulness and describes the mindfulness-based intervention movement, (2) synthesizes the neuroscience of mindfulness and integrates motivation and learning mechanisms within a mindful self-regulation model for understanding the complex effects of mindfulness on behavior change, and (3) synthesizes current clinical research evaluating the effects of mindfulness-based interventions targeting health behaviors relevant to psychiatric care. The review provides insight into the limitations of current research and proposes potential mechanisms to be tested in future research and targeted in clinical practice to enhance the impact of mindfulness on behavior change.},

  abstract = {The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group represents an international collaboration of guideline developers, clinicians, health services researchers and methodologists. Many leading organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), use the GRADE approach because it has led to progress in the assessment of evidence and in the development of healthcare recommendations. The GRADE system distinguishes the quality of evidence from the strength of a recommendation. The quality of evidence reflects the extent of confidence that an estimate of effect is correct if it is used in the context of single endpoints. In the context of giving guidance, it reflects the extent to which confidence in an estimate of the effect is adequate to support recommendations. The strength of a recommendation, separated into strong and weak or conditional recommendations for or against an intervention, is defined as the extent to which one can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh the undesirable effects. A recommendation for action requires consideration for the magnitude of the expected benefit and downsides of an intervention for all patientimportant endpoints, the associate values and preferences and resource use. The GRADE system includes a systematic approach to evaluate the generalizability of study results to healthcare practice. Judgments about generalizability, better termed directness, are separated into judgments about the availability of direct comparisons between two alternative management strategies and judgments about differences between the population, intervention, comparator to the intervention, and outcomes (PICO) of interest for a given question, and those included in the relevant studies. In addition to providing an overview of the GRADE system, this article focuses on the approach to assessing directness or generalizability.},

Mindfulness was more strongly associated with dispositional, or trait, flow than with state flow. Both mindfulness and flow have connections with a variety of beneficial outcomes.

A heterogeneous sample of 104 chronic pain outpatients at a multidisciplinary pain clinic in Australia completed psychometrically sound self-report measures of major variables in this model: Pain intensity, negative affect, pain catastrophizing, pain-related fear, pain hypervigilance, and functional disability. Two measures of mindfulness were also used, the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale [4] and the Five-Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire [1]. Results showed that mindfulness significantly negatively predicts each of these variables, accounting for 17-41\% of their variance. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that mindfulness uniquely predicts pain catastrophizing when other variables are controlled, and moderates the relationship between pain intensity and pain catastrophizing. This is the first clear evidence substantiating the strong link between mindfulness and pain catastrophizing, and suggests mindfulness might be added to the fear-avoidance model. Implications for the clinical use of mindfulness in screening and intervention are discussed.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In fact, Ss reported higher assertiveness after recalling 12 unassertive rather than 12 assertive behaviors.

Hoffrage's (1995) ecological framework, the authors wrote a computerized tutorial program to train people to construct frequency representations (representation training) rather than to insert probabilities into Bayes's rule (rule training). Bayesian computations are simpler to perform with natural frequencies than with probabilities, and there are evolutionary reasons for assuming that cognitive algorithms have been developed to deal with natural frequencies. In 2 studies, the authors compared representation training with rule training; the criteria were an immediate learning effect, transfer to new problems, and long-term temporal stability. Rule training was as good in transfer as representation training, but representation training had a higher immediate learning effect and greater temporal stability.},

  abstract = {In this meta-analysis, we give a comprehensive overview of the effects of meditation on psychological variables that can be extracted from empirical studies, concentrating on the effects of meditation on nonclinical groups of adult meditators. Mostly because of methodological problems, almost ¾ of an initially identified 595 studies had to be excluded. Most studies appear to have been conducted without sufficient theoretical background. To put the results into perspective, we briefly summarize the major theoretical approaches from both East and West. The 163 studies that allowed the calculation of effect sizes exhibited medium average effects (r = .28 for all studies and r = .27 for the n = 125 studies from reviewed journals), which cannot be explained by mere relaxation or cognitive restructuring effects. In general, results were strongest (medium to large) for changes in emotionality and relationship issues, less strong (about medium) for measures of attention, and weakest (small to medium) for more cognitive measures. However, specific findings varied across different approaches to meditation (transcendental meditation, mindfulness meditation, and other meditation techniques). Surprisingly, meditation experience only partially covaried with long-term impact on the variables examined. In general, the dependent variables used cover only some of the content areas about which predictions can be made from already existing theories about meditation; still, such predictions lack precision at present. We conclude that to arrive at a comprehensive understanding of why and how meditation works, emphasis should be placed on the development of more precise theories and measurement devices.},

Unfortunately, they are often incorrectly viewed as an error probability for rejection of the hypothesis or, even worse, as the posterior probability that the hypothesis is true. The fact that these interpretations can be completely misleading when testing precise hypotheses is first reviewed, through consideration of two revealing simulations. Then two calibrations of a ρ value are developed, the first being interpretable as odds and the second as either a (conditional) frequentist error probability or as the posterior probability of the hypothesis.},

Main outcome measure Psychometric properties of both the 15-item (complete) and 3-item (shortened) versions of the CTM in Hebrew and Arabic. Reliability established using internal consistency with Cronbach's-alpha. Exploratory factor analysis conducted using Varimax rotation. Convergent validity determined with Pearson correlation and ANOVA tests.: Three hundred and eighteen Hebrew- and Arabic-speaking oncology patients completed the questionnaire. Cronbach's-alpha for the questionnaire was 0.94 and 0.90 for the Hebrew and the Arabic versions, respectively. Factor analysis resulted in three factors in each of the translated versions with a cumulative variance of 73.41\% and 69.2\% in the Hebrew and Arabic versions, respectively. Tests of the convergent validity showed that the measure is correlated with health status and that the shortened and complete versions' ratings are consistent across different patient groups.: The translated Hebrew and Arabic versions of the questionnaire are reliable and valid instruments to assess patients' transitions across settings in diverse populations.},

  abstract = {In the social and economic sciences, there has been a trend towards assigning individual pref- erences and values greater importance in establishing the microanalytical foundations for a theory of human action. This development can also be observed for the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) survey, which in recent years has also been expanded to include several psy- chological indicators. The Machiavellianism and Egoism Scales were integrated into the 2006 SOEP Pretest, which was carried out in preparation for future waves of the main survey, pro- viding the opportunity to test two more individual values relevant to action for their applica- bility to the SOEP standard battery of questions. The goal is to generate short item scales on the basis of established inventories that meet psychometric standards and are also connected with everyday action indicators. The three-item inventories developed display only moderate internal coherence but show the intended factor structure. Additionally, the short scales are also able to replicate the results of the original inventories. All in all, there is little evidence that the preferences under study are connected with socio-demographic characteristics; rather, they can be linked to personality indicators. Overall, we can observe the assumed connections to everyday life indicators in the expected direction, but their validity is limited by the size of the effect.},

In astronomy, over the past decade, we have also seen a steady increase in the number of papers that employ Monte Carlo–based Bayesian analysis. New, efficient Monte Carlo–based methods are continuously being developed and explored. In this review, we first explain the basics of Bayesian theory and discuss how to set up data analysis problems within this framework. Next, we provide an overview of various Monte Carlo–based methods for performing Bayesian data analysis. Finally, we discuss advanced ideas that enable us to tackle complex problems and thus hold great promise for the future. We also distribute downloadable computer software (https://github.com/sanjibs/bmcmc) Python that implements some of the algorithms and examples discussed here.}

  abstract = {Descriptive IRT vs. Prescriptive Rasch Item response theory (IRT) generally refers to three probabilistic measurement models: the 1-parameter (identical to the dichotomous Rasch model), the 2-parameter, and the 3-parameter, named by the number of item parameters estimated in each model. All three models can be specified from a single probabilistic function for the occurrence of a right answer by a person to an item: P(x=1) = ci - (1-ci) exp (ai(t-bi)) / (1 + exp (ai(t-bi))) where the three item parameters are ci = low asymptote of ogive (guessing) bi = median intercept of ogive (difficulty) ai = slope of ogive at inflection (discrimination) and the one person parameter is t = ability of a person on the variable. Making ci constant produces 2-parameter estimation. Making ai constant produces 1-parameter estimation. This approach seems to imply that the Rasch model is just a stripped- down version of more complicated models which "must be better" because they account for more of the "presumed reality" of traditional test theory. Quite apart from Occam's razor (that entities are not multiplied beyond necessity), this interpretation is shallow in an essential way. That the Rasch model can be reached by simplifying more complicated models has nothing to do with its genesis or rationale, or with the theory of measurement. The Rasch model is not intended to fit data or to be evaluated by how well it fits any particular data set. The Rasch model is a definition of measurement derived from the universally accepted measurement requirements that: 1. The measures of objects be free of the particulars of the agents used to estimate these measures and the calibrations of agents be free of the particulars of the objects used to estimate these calibrations. 2. The measures of objects and calibrations of agents function according to the rules of arithmetic on a common scale so that they can be analyzed statistically. 3. Linear combinations of measures and calibrations correspond to plausible concatenations of objects and agents. Introducing the superfluous parameters, ai and ci, violates these requirements and disqualifies the resulting contrivances as "measurement" models. Were the values of t known prior to analysis, the 2- and 3-parameter formulations could be used to specify two, among many possible, logistic regressions, as they have been in biometric analysis for 60 years. When t is not known and must be estimated from the same data, as is the case for measurement, then it can be demonstrated algebraically that the parameter estimates must diverge unless constrained in an arbitrary manner. In practice, arbitrary interference, such as limiting the range of ai and ci, does not produce sample-free item calibrations or test-free person measures - unless ai and ci are restricted to constants, when, of course, the formulation becomes a Rasch model and functions accordingly. This is the misunderstanding of those who claim the 2- and 3-parameter computer programs "work". In the few instances where serious 2- and 3-parameter results are reported, their quality is proportional to the extent to which ai and ci were kept from varying - from being influenced by the data. Indeed all important practical IRT applications reported at the 1991 AERA meeting were implemented by the Rasch model. In theory and in practice, the Rasch model is a unique measurement archetype.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:There is a growing awareness of the need for easily administered, psychometrically sound screening tools to identify individuals with elevated levels of psychological distress. Although support has been found for the psychometric properties of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS) using classical test theory approaches it has not been subjected to Rasch analysis. The aim of this study was to use Rasch analysis to assess the psychometric properties of the DASS-21 scales, using two different administration modes.METHODS:The DASS-21 was administered to 420 participants with half the sample responding to a web-based version and the other half completing a traditional pencil-and-paper version. Conformity of DASS-21 scales to a Rasch partial credit model was assessed using the RUMM2020 software.RESULTS:To achieve adequate model fit it was necessary to remove one item from each of the DASS-21 subscales. The reduced scales showed adequate internal consistency reliability, unidimensionality and freedom from differential item functioning for sex, age and mode of administration. Analysis of all DASS-21 items combined did not support its use as a measure of general psychological distress. A scale combining the anxiety and stress items showed satisfactory fit to the Rasch model after removal of three items.CONCLUSION:The results provide support for the measurement properties, internal consistency reliability, and unidimensionality of three slightly modified DASS-21 scales, across two different administration methods. The further use of Rasch analysis on the DASS-21 in larger and broader samples is recommended to confirm the findings of the current study.},

Method: Forty-six participants were randomly assigned to an 8-week yoga intervention group or a wait-list control group. Mindfulness was assessed pre and post yoga, using the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI). Results: Results indicate that the yoga group experienced a significant increase in Overall mindfulness, and in three mindfulness subscales; Attention to the present moment, Accepting and open attitudes toward experience, and Insightful understanding (p {$<$} .01). The control group experienced a significant increase in overall mindfulness (p {$<$} .02) and insightful understanding (p {$<$} .01). Findings suggest that a yoga intervention may be a viable method for increasing levels of trait mindfulness in a healthy population, potentially implicating yoga as a preventive method for the later development of negative emotional mood states (i.e. anxiety and depression). The control group also experienced moderate elevations of mindfulness at the second assessment.},

  abstract = {Many of the options available to decision makers, such as college majors and romantic partners, can become unavailable if sufficient effort is not invested in them (taking classes, sending flowers). The question asked in this work is whether a threat of disappearance changes the way people value such options. In four experiments using “door games,” we demonstrate that options that threaten to disappear cause decision makers to invest more effort and money in keeping these options open, even when the options themselves seem to be of little interest. This general tendency is shown to be resilient to information about the outcomes, to increased experience, and to the saliency of the cost. The last experiment provides initial evidence that the mechanism underlying the tendency to keep doors open is a type of aversion to loss rather than a desire for flexibility.},

  abstract = {Problem-based learning (PBL) has been identified as an approach that improves the training of nurses by teaching them how to apply theory to clinical practice and by developing their problem-solving skills, which could be used to overcome environmental constraints within clinical practice. A consensus is emerging that there is a need for systematic reviews and meta-analyses regarding a range of selected topics in nursing education. The purpose of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of the available literature in order to synthesize the effects of PBL in nursing education. Using a number of databases, we identified studies related to the effectiveness of PBL in nursing. An analysis was conducted on a range of outcome variables, including overall effect sizes and effects of evidence and evaluation levels, learning environment, and study characteristics. We found that the effect of PBL in nursing education is 0.70 standard deviations (medium-to-large effect size). We also found that PBL has positive effects on the outcome domains of satisfaction with training, clinical education, and skill course. These results may act as a guide for nurse educators with regard to the conditions under which PBL is more effective than traditional learning strategies.}

Prognostic models based on pre-treatment characteristics, such as the International Prognostic Index (IPI), are currently used to predict outcome in DLBCL. However, clinical outcome models identify neither the molecular basis of clinical heterogeneity, nor specific therapeutic targets. We analyzed the expression of 6,817 genes in diagnostic tumor specimens from DLBCL patients who received cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP)-based chemotherapy, and applied a supervised learning prediction method to identify cured versus fatal or refractory disease. The algorithm classified two categories of patients with very different five-year overall survival rates (70\% versus 12\%). The model also effectively delineated patients within specific IPI risk categories who were likely to be cured or to die of their disease. Genes implicated in DLBCL outcome included some that regulate responses to B-cell-receptor signaling, critical serine/threonine phosphorylation pathways and apoptosis. Our data indicate that supervised learning classification techniques can predict outcome in DLBCL and identify rational targets for intervention.},

  abstract = {Working memory (WM) is a cognitive system that strongly relates to a person's ability to reason with novel information and direct attention to goal-relevant information. Due to the central role that WM plays in general cognition, it has become the focus of a rapidly growing training literature that seeks to affect broad cognitive change through prolonged training on WM tasks. Recent work has suggested that the effects of WM training extend to general fluid intelligence, attentional control, and reductions in symptoms of ADHD. We present a theoretically motivated perspective of WM and subsequently review the WM training literature in light of several concerns. These include (a) the tendency for researchers to define change to abilities using single tasks, (b) inconsistent use of valid WM tasks, (c) no-contact control groups, and (d) subjective measurement of change. The literature review highlights several findings that warrant further research but ultimately concludes that there is a need to directly demonstrate that WM capacity increases in response to training. Specifically, we argue that transfer of training to WM must be demonstrated using a wider variety of tasks, thus eliminating the possibility that results can be explained by task specific learning. Additionally, we express concern that many of the most promising results (e.g., increased intelligence) cannot be readily attributed to changes in WM capacity. Thus, a critical goal for future research is to uncover the mechanisms that lead to transfer of training. © 2012 American Psychological Association.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE To apply Rasch analysis to the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) responses of a mixed neurorehabilitation sample to determine its suitability for assessing depression among this group. METHOD Three hundred and fifteen in-patients undergoing post-acute specialist in-patient rehabilitation at the Regional Rehabilitation Unit (RRU) of Northwick Park Hospital in North London were administered the Beck Depression Inventory. All patients were administered the BDI-II by a clinical psychologist using a large print version and taking as much time as patients required. Rasch analysis was completed using the RUMM2020 software. Where disordered thresholds were identified item rescoring was undertaken. Each item was also examined for Differential Item Functioning. Where misfit to model expectations was identified items were removed in an iterative fashion. The effect of any deletion upon person estimates was examined. Specific tests of unidimensionality were undertaken at each iterative phase. RESULTS Rescoring was necessary before Items 1-4, 6, 8-12, 20 and 21 showed ordered thresholds. Three items failed to satisfy model expectations - items 16 (changes in sleeping pattern), 18 (changes in appetite) and 21 (loss of interest in sex) and were deleted - after which good overall fit to the Rasch model was observed. The three items deleted affected person estimates in a significant way such that the 21 item version in this group of patients may be biased because of multidimensionality. CONCLUSIONS The BDI-II in a sample of patients undergoing neurorehabilitation satisfies unidimensional Rasch model expectations in an 18-item format. Some disordering of response categories was evident, but this evidence requires replication before any common rescoring option should be considered.},

  abstract = {Objective To review mindfulness and the mindfulness assessment scales according to Kabat-Zinn’ s concept. Materials and methods Documentary reviewed by using~ 2 words i.e. sati and mindfulness as key words to search via~ Google search engine from December 2013 – April 2014. Results There were 24 articles retrieved. According to Kabat-Zinn, mindfulness composed 2 domains i.e., 7 items of cognitive domain and 5 items of affective domian which magnified by Shaprio and Swartz. Bishoped et al described an operation definition composed 2 factors that is, awareness and acceptance which 7 assessment scales’ developers used to generate the items. There were eight assessment scales based on self report containing 1-5 domains and were vary between 10–39 items. The differences in culture and concept of mindfulness practice impact the application of these assessment scales in Thailand. Conclusion Mindfulness and the assessment scales according to Kabat-Zinn had both positive and limited issues in Thailand.}

  abstract = {In this article, we accomplish two things. First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

We introduce p-curve as a way to answer this question. P-curve is the distribution of statistically significant p values for a set of studies (ps {$<$} .05). Because only true effects are expected to generate right-skewed p-curves-containing more low (.01s) than high (.04s) significant p values--only right-skewed p--curves are diagnostic of evidential value. By telling us whether we can rule out selective reporting as the sole explanation for a set of findings, p-curve offers a solution to the age-old inferential problems caused by file-drawers of failed studies and analyses.},

Its benefits include the following: (a) differentiating “unsuccessful” replication attempts (i.e., studies yielding p {$>$} .05) that are too noisy from those that actively indicate the effect is undetectably different from zero, (b) “protecting” true findings from underpowered replications, and (c) arriving at intuitively compelling inferences in general and for the revisited replications in particular.},

In our questionnaire-based study, comprising the data of 587 undergraduate students we examined the association between trait anxiety, perceived stress, trait mindfulness, negative dream affect and dream anxiety. Our results indicate that mindfulness is inversely related to disturbed dreaming and predicts less severe dream disturbances after controlling for trait anxiety. Moreover, the results of the applied hierarchical regression analysis suggest that mindfulness is associated with reduced dream anxiety by moderating the extent of waking anxiety. Our findings extend previous research relating mindfulness, emotional regulation and sleep quality to the domain of dream research. We suggest that mindfulness is a possible protective factor against dream disturbances.},

In one group Ss were required to judge the pitch equality of tones and, subsequently, indicate their decision by pressing or not pressing a telegraph key. In the other group Ss were required to make the pitch-discriminations, but the key press response was unrelated to the preceding cognitive task. Continuous photographs of each S's pupil were taken during the experiment. Results showed that a small amount of pupillary dilation occurred during the discrimination task in the group where the key press was irrelevant to the pitch-discrimination. In the group where S's behavior indicated task fulfillment, however, a significantly greater increase in pupil size occurred, the amount of dilation being larger when task completion was indicated by the key press response than when fulfillment was indicated by no key press. The findings were discussed in terms of arousal associated with apprehension about evaluation, and muscle tension from anticipation of making the overt response.

  abstract = {Understanding individual differences in attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence (AI) is of importance, among others in system development. Against this background, we sought to investigate associations between personality and attitudes towards AI. Relations were investigated in~samples from two countries—Germany and China—to find potentially replicable, cross-culturally applicable associations. In German (N\,=\,367, n\,=\,137 men) and Chinese (N\,=\,879; n\,=\,220 men) online surveys, participants completed items on sociodemographic variables, the Attitudes Towards Artificial Intelligence (ATAI) scale, and the Big Five Inventory. Correlational analysis revealed among others significant positive associations between Neuroticism and fear of AI in both samples, with similar effect sizes. In addition to a significant association of acceptance of AI with gender, regression analyses revealed a small but significant positive association between Neuroticism and fear of AI in the German sample. In the Chinese sample, regression analyses showed positive associations of acceptance of AI with age, Openness, and Agreeableness. Fear of AI was only~significantly negatively related to Agreeableness in the Chinese sample. The association of fear of AI with Neuroticism just failed to be significant in the regression model in the Chinese sample. These results reveal important insights into associations between certain personality traits and attitudes towards AI. However, given mostly small effect sizes of relations between personality and attitudes towards AI, other factors aside from personality traits seem to be of relevance to explain variance in individuals’ attitudes towards AI, as well.},

Understanding the contribution of physical fitness components to functional performance facilitates the development of adequate exercise interventions aiming at preservation of function and independence of older people. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between physical fitness components and functional performance in older people living in long-term care facilities. METHODS: Design cross-sectional study. Subjects 226 persons living in long-term care facilities (mean age: 81.6 +/- 5.6). Outcome measures Physical fitness and functional performance were measured by performance-based tests. RESULTS: Knee and elbow extension strength were significantly higher in men (difference = 44.5 and 50.0 N, respectively), whereas women were more flexible (difference sit \& reach test = 7.2 cm). Functional performance was not significantly different between the genders. In men, motor coordination (eye-hand coordination) and measures of strength were the main contributors to functional performance, whereas in women flexibility (sit and reach test) and motor coordination (tandem stance and eye-hand coordination) played a major role. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that besides muscle strength, fitness components such as coordination and flexibility are associated with functional performance of older people living in long-term care facilities. This suggests that men and women living in long-term care facilities, differ considerably concerning the fitness factors contributing to functional performance. Women and men may, therefore, need exercise programs emphasizing different fitness aspects in order to improve functional performance.},

  abstract = {The information processing capacity of the human mind is limited, as is evidenced by the so-called "attentional-blink" deficit: When two targets (T1 and T2) embedded in a rapid stream of events are presented in close temporal proximity, the second target is often not seen. This deficit is believed to result from competition between the two targets for limited attentional resources. Here we show, using performance in an attentional-blink task and scalp-recorded brain potentials, that meditation, or mental training, affects the distribution of limited brain resources. Three months of intensive mental training resulted in a smaller attentional blink and reduced brain-resource allocation to the first target, as reflected by a smaller T1-elicited P3b, a brain-potential index of resource allocation. Furthermore, those individuals that showed the largest decrease in brain-resource allocation to T1 generally showed the greatest reduction in attentional-blink size. These observations provide novel support for the view that the ability to accurately identify T2 depends upon the efficient deployment of resources to T1. The results also demonstrate that mental training can result in increased control over the distribution of limited brain resources. Our study supports the idea that plasticity in brain and mental function exists throughout life and illustrates the usefulness of systematic mental training in the study of the human mind.},

Reliable quantitation may refine observations of this phenomenon to better aid research on this entity.Methods: A panel equipped with timing sensors under computer control was used to measure upper extremity movement times in two groups of healthy individuals: adults younger than 60 years of age (n = 56; range, 18--58 years) and adults older than 60 years of age (n = 38; range, 61--94 years).Results: Fine motor performance was better in the dominant hand (p = 0.0007) regardless of age. Adult and aged groups differed on two basic timing measures, which reflect coarse motor and fine motor performance (p {$<$} 0.0001). There were no gender differences on either measure. There was a strong effect of task difficulty with age on coarse motor (p {$<$} 0.01) and fine motor (p {$<$} 0.0001) measures. The fine motor measure of hand performance in healthy individuals correlated in a nonlinear fashion with age for more difficult tasks (r2 = 0.63) but showed a simple linear relation for less-demanding tasks (r2 = 0.5).Conclusion: This technique sensitively detects age-related motor performance decline in humans. There may be a critical period in late midlife when fine motor performance decline either begins or abruptly worsens.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: No published quantitative instrument exists to measure maternal satisfaction with the quality of different models of labour care in the UK. METHODS: A quantitative psychometric multidimensional maternal satisfaction questionnaire, the Women's Views of Birth Labour Satisfaction Questionnaire (WOMBLSQ), was developed using principal components analysis with varimax rotation of successive versions. Internal reliability and content and construct validity were assessed. RESULTS: Of 300 women sent the first version (WOMBLSQ1), 120 (40\%) replied; of 300 sent WOMBLSQ2, 188 (62.7\%) replied; of 500 women sent WOMBLSQ3, 319 (63.8\%) replied; and of 2400 women sent WOMBLSQ4, 1683 (70.1\%) replied. The latter two versions consisted of 10 dimensions in addition to general satisfaction. These were (Cronbach's alpha): professional support in labour (0.91), expectations of labour (0.90), home assessment in early labour (0.90), holding the baby (0.87), support from husband/partner (0.83), pain relief in labour (0.83), pain relief immediately after labour (0.65), knowing labour carers (0.82), labour environment (0.80), and control in labour (0.62). There were moderate correlations (range 0.16-0.73) between individual dimensions and the general satisfaction scale (0.75). Scores on individual dimensions were significantly related to a range of clinical and demographic variables. CONCLUSION: This multidimensional labour satisfaction instrument has good validity and internal reliability. It could be used to assess care in labour across different models of maternity care, or as a prelude to in depth exploration of specific areas of concern. Its external reliability and transferability to care outside the South West region needs further evaluation, particularly in terms of ethnicity and social class.},

  volume = {4},

  abstract = {The invariance of the estimated parameters across variation in the incidental parameters of a sample is one of the most important properties of Rasch measurement models. This is the property that allows the equating of test forms and the use of computer adaptive testing. It necessarily follows that in Rasch models if the data fit the model, than the estimation of the parameter of interest must be invariant across sub-samples of the items or persons. This study investigates the degree to which the INFIT and OUTFIT item fit statistics in WINSTEPS detect violations of the invariance property of Rasch measurement models. The test in this study is a 80 item multiple-choice test used to assess mathematics competency. The WINSTEPS analysis of the dichotomous results, based on a sample of 2000 from a very large number of students who took the exam, indicated that only 7 of the 80 items misfit using the 1.3 mean square criteria advocated by Linacre and Wright. Subsequent calibration of separate samples of 1,000 students from the upper and lower third of the person raw score distribution, followed by a t-test comparison of the item calibrations, indicated that the item difficulties for 60 of the 80 items were more than 2 standard errors apart. The separate calibration t-values ranged from +21.00 to -7.00 with the t-test value of 41 of the 80 comparisons either larger than +5 or smaller than -5. Clearly these data do not exhibit the invariance of the item parameters expected if the data fit the model. Yet the INFIT and OUTFIT mean squares are completely insensitive to the lack of invariance in the item parameters. If the OUTFIT ZSTD from WINSTEPS was used with a critical value of | t | {$>$} 2.0, then 56 of the 60 items identified by the separate calibration t-test would be identified as misfitting. A fourth measure of misfit, the between ability-group item fit statistic identified 69 items as misfitting when a critical value of t {$>$} 2.0 was used. Clearly relying solely on the INFIT and OUTFIT mean squares in WINSETPS to assess the fit of the data to the model would cause one to miss one of the most important threats to the usefulness of the measurement model.},

Examples are percentages that sum to 100, and hours in a day that sum to 24. Ipsative scales fell out of fashion in psychology during the 1960s and 1970s due to a lack of methods for analyzing them. However, ipsative scales have merits, and compositional data commonly occur in psychological research. Moreover, as we demonstrate, sometimes converting data to a compositional form yields insights not otherwise accessible. Fortunately, there are sound methods for analyzing compositional data. We seek to enable researchers to analyze compositional data by presenting appropriate techniques and illustrating their application to real data. First, we elaborate the technical details of compositional data and discuss both established and new approaches to their analysis. We then present applications of these methods to real social science data-sets (data and code using R are available in a supplementary document). We conclude with a discussion of the state of the art in compositional data analysis and remaining unsolved problems. A brief guide to available software resources is provided in the first section of the supplementary document. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

These comparisons demonstrate that, if the use of loops is avoided, R code can efficiently integrate problems comprising several thousands of state variables. Nevertheless, the same problem may be solved from 2 to more than 50 times faster by using compiled code compared to an implementation using only R code. Still, amongst the bene fits of R are a more flexible and interactive implementation, better readability of the code, and access to R's high-level procedures. deSolve is the successor of packageo desolve which will be deprecated in the future; it is free software and distributed under the GNU General Public License, as part of the R software project.},

These comparisons demonstrate that, if the use of loops is avoided, R code can efficiently integrate problems comprising several thousands of state variables. Nevertheless, the same problem may be solved from 2 to more than 50 times faster by using compiled code compared to an implementation using only R code. Still, amongst the bene fits of R are a more flexible and interactive implementation, better readability of the code, and access to R's high-level procedures. deSolve is the successor of packageo desolve which will be deprecated in the future; it is free software and distributed under the GNU General Public License, as part of the R software project.},

  abstract = {We contend that generalizability (G) theory allows design of psychometric approaches to testing English-language learners (EELs) that are consistent with current thinking in linguistics. We used G theory to estimate the amount of measurement error due to code (language or dialect). Fourth - and fifth-grade ELLs, native speakers of Haitian-Creole from two speech communities, were given the same set of mathematics items in the standard English and standard Haitian-Creole dialects (Sample 1) or in the standard and local dialects of Haitian-Creole (Samples 2 and 3). The largest measurement error observed was produced by the interaction of student, item and code. Our results indicate that the reliability and dependability of ELL achievement measures is affected by two facts that operate in combination: Each test item poses a unique set of linguistic challenges and each student has a unique set of linguistic strengths and weaknesses. This sensitivity to language appears to take place at the level of dialect. Also, students from different speech communities within the same broad linguistic group may differ considerably in the number of items needed to obtain dependable measures of their academic achievement. Whether students are tested in English or in their first language, dialect variation needs to be considered if language as a source of measurement error is to be effectively addressed.},

The results of four studies suggest that when faced with difficult questions, people are primed to think about computers and that when people expect to have future access to information, they have lower rates of recall of the information itself and enhanced recall instead for where to access it.

  abstract = {The evaluation of how (human) individuals perceive robots is a central issue to better understand human–robot interaction (HRI). On this topic, promising proposals have emerged. However, present tools are not able to assess a sufficient part of the composite psychological dimensions involved in the evaluation of HRI. Indeed, the percentage of variance explained is often under the recommended threshold for a construct to be valid. In this article, we consolidate the lessons learned from three different studies and propose a further developed questionnaire based on a multicomponent approach of anthropomorphism by adding traits from psychosocial theory about the perception of others and the attribution and deprivation of human characteristics: the de-humanization theory. Among these characteristics, the attribution of agency is of main interest in the field of social robotics as it has been argued that robots could be considered as intentional agents. Factor analyses reveal a four sub-dimensions scale including Sociability, Agency, Animacy, and the Disturbance. We discuss the implication(s) of these dimensions on future perception of and attitudes towards robots.},

Thus, predicting adolescent cannabis use prior to any exposure will inform the aetiology of substance abuse by disentangling predictors from consequences of use. In this prediction study, data were drawn from the IMAGEN sample, a longitudinal study of adolescence. All selected participants (n~=~1,581) were cannabis-naïve at age 14. Those reporting any cannabis use (out of six ordinal use levels) by age 16 were included in the outcome group (N~=~365, males n~=~207). Cannabis-naïve participants at age 14 and 16 were included in the comparison group (N~=~1,216, males n~=~538). Psychosocial, brain and genetic features were measured at age 14 prior to any exposure. Cross-validated regularized logistic regressions for each use level by sex were used to perform feature selection and obtain prediction error statistics on independent observations. Predictors were probed for sex- and drug-specificity using post-hoc logistic regressions. Models reliably predicted use as indicated by satisfactory prediction error statistics, and contained psychosocial features common to both sexes. However, males and females exhibited distinct brain predictors that failed to predict use in the opposite sex or predict binge drinking in independent samples of same-sex participants. Collapsed across sex, genetic variation on catecholamine and opioid receptors marginally predicted use. Using machine learning techniques applied to a large multimodal dataset, we identified a risk profile containing psychosocial and sex-specific brain prognostic markers, which were likely to precede and influence cannabis initiation.},

Whereas numerous meta-analyses have investigated the effectiveness of face-to-face MBIs in the context of mental health and well-being, thus far a quantitative synthesis of the effectiveness of online MBIs is lacking. The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the overall effects of online MBIs on mental health. Fifteen randomised controlled trials were included in this study. A random effects model was used to compute pre-post between-group effect sizes, and the study quality of each of the included trials was rated. Results showed that online MBIs have a small but significant beneficial impact on depression (g=0.29), anxiety (g=0.22), well-being (g=0.23) and mindfulness (g=0.32). The largest effect was found for stress, with a moderate effect size (g=0.51). For stress and mindfulness, exploratory subgroup analyses demonstrated significantly higher effect sizes for guided online MBIs than for unguided online MBIs. In addition, meta-regression analysis showed that effect sizes for stress were significantly moderated by the number of intervention sessions. Effect sizes, however, were not significantly related to study quality. The findings indicate that online MBIs have potential to contribute to improving mental health outcomes, particularly stress. Limitations, directions for future research and practical implications are discussed.},

A major aim of the GOSAT lies in the utilization of different modes of measurement, (i.e., peer reports and observational data), in addition to self-reports which have been used predominantly in past behavioral genetic research on personality and temperament in adults. Participants completed a full day assessment at the University of Bielefeld including videotaped social interactions and presentations, psychometric intelligence tests and computerized elementary cognitive tasks as well as objective measures and unobtrusive behavior counts. The research design of the GOSAT was devised to reduce the potential impact of systematic rater bias on estimates of genetic and environmental influences to a minimum. In combination with extensive self- and peer report data on key personality and personality related dimensions available from the BiLSAT, the GOSAT provides a rich dataset, which currently includes DNA samples from 80\% of its participants.},

There was good agreement between PHQ diagnoses and those of independent mental health professionals (for the diagnosis of any 1 or more PHQ disorder, κ = 0.65; overall accuracy, 85\%; sensitivity, 75\%; specificity, 90\%), similar to the original PRIME-MD. Patients with PHQ diagnoses had more functional impairment, disability days, and health care use than did patients without PHQ diagnoses (for all group main effects, P{$<$}.001). The average time required of the physician to review the PHQ was far less than to administer the original PRIME-MD ({$<$}3 minutes for 85\% vs 16\% of the cases). Although 80\% of the physicians reported that routine use of the PHQ would be useful, new management actions were initiated or planned for only 117 (32\%) of the 363 patients with 1 or more PHQ diagnoses not previously recognized.Conclusion Our study suggests that the PHQ has diagnostic validity comparable to the original clinician-administered PRIME-MD, and is more efficient to use.},

Patient raters across all countries expressed different concerns about some of the demographic questions and their relevance for evaluating patient satisfaction. Removing demographic questions from the evaluation produced a significant improvement in the scale-level scores (P= .018). The cross-cultural evaluation process suggested that translations and content of the patient satisfaction survey were relevant across countries and languages.Conclusions The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey is relevant to some European hospital systems and has the potential to produce internationally comparable patient satisfaction scores.}

  abstract = {Much research in the last two decades has demonstrated that human responses deviate from the performance deemed normative according to various models of decision making and rational judgment (e.g., the basic axioms of utility theory). This gap between the normative and the descriptive can be interpreted as indicating systematic irrationalities in human cognition. However, four alternative interpretations preserve the assumption that human behavior and cognition is largely rational. These posit that the gap is due to (1) performance errors, (2) computational limitations, (3) the wrong norm being applied by the experimenter, and (4) a different construal of the task by the subject. In the debates about the viability of these alternative explanations, attention has been focused too narrowly on the model response. In a series of experiments involving most of the classic tasks in the heuristics and biases literature, we have examined the implications of individual differences in performance for each of the four explanations of the normative/descriptive gap. Performance errors are a minor factor in the gap; computational limitations underlie non-normative responding on several tasks, particularly those that involve some type of cognitive decontextualization. Unexpected patterns of covariance can suggest when the wrong norm is being applied to a task or when an alternative construal of the task should be considered appropriate.},

There are individual differences in rational thinking that are less than perfectly correlated with individual differences in intelligence because intelligence and rationality occupy different conceptual locations in models of cognition. A tripartite extension of currently popular dual-process theories is presented in this chapter that illustrates how intelligence and rationality are theoretically separate concepts. The chapter concludes by showing how this tripartite model of mind, taken in the context of studies of individual differences, can help to resolve the Great Rationality Debate.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose. The purpose of this study was to do a pilot test of the effectiveness of prolonged stretch (use of a splint) in reducing knee flexion contractures more than a traditional program of passive range of motion (PROM) in a group of nursing home residents. Subjects. The subjects were 28 nursing home residents with 10 degrees or more of knee flexion contracture bilaterally. Eighteen subjects completed the study. Methods. Data were collected prior to the initiation of the intervention and at monthly intervals during the 6 months of treatment. Repeated measurements were made of hip, knee, and ankle range of motion (ROM); the torque required to maintain passive knee extension; knee pain; several indicators of function; and cognitive impairment. Both legs of each subject received PROM and manual stretching twice a week; in addition, one leg was given a prolonged stretch (use of a splint) five times a week. Results. There were no differences in knee ROM between the side that received prolonged stretching and the side that received only PROM and manual stretching at the beginning of the study. No differences in ROM or torque measurements existed between the side that received prolonged stretching and the side that received only PROM and manual stretching at any interval, nor in ROM or torque over time for either side. Because of the low statistical power of the study, the results should be viewed with caution. Conclusion and Discussion. Physical therapists need to question whether prolonged stretch for nursing home residents with knee flexion contractures greater than 10 degrees is of any greater benefit than PROM and manual stretching. Investigations of other treatment protocols and treatment doses are needed, including work in the area of prevention of knee flexion contractures. For the pilot group of nursing home residents studied, gains in knee extension did not occur with the use of prolonged stretch for 3 hours a day, 5 days per week.}

  abstract = {The contributions of separate sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways to pupillary dilation during a sustained processing task were studied through environmental and pharmacological manipulations. In Experiment 1, 22 healthy volunteers (11 female) performed a serial Subtract 7 task while pupil diameter was recorded both during moderate room light and in darkness. In a control for verbalization, subjects performed an easier Add 1 task. In all conditions, pupil diameter increased significantly during the response period as compared to a pre-verbalization baseline period. Pupillary dilation was increased for the difficult task, and further increase in dilation was associated with recording in light. This suggests a major differential contribution to task difficulty mediated through inhibition of the parasympathetic pathway. In Experiment 2, a subgroup of 12 volunteers (seven female) repeated all conditions at three additional sessions in which one eye was instilled with tropicamide (to block the parasympathetic sphincter muscle), dapiprazole (to block the sympathetic dilator muscle) or placebo. All pharmacological conditions resulted in overall dilation during task performance. Differential performance similar to the placebo condition was seen only in the dapiprazole condition, when parasympathetic activation was intact. The findings suggest that sustained performance during a difficult task is modulated by cortical inhibition of the parasympathetic pathway at the oculomotor nucleus. Moreover, modulation of both ambient light intensity and pharmacological blockade of the final pupillary musculature were observed to provide converging approaches for quantifying the activity of identifiable central autonomic pathways.},

  abstract = {In cardiac pacing current clinical practice permits the use of ventricular or atrioventricular-synchronous pacemakers. However, it is not known which type of pacemaker results in superior clinical and patient outcomes. To date, there is no feasible and validated disease-specific questionnaire for pacemaker patients to assess quality of life (QoL) available. The Aquarel questionnaire was developed as a disease-specific extension to the Short-Form-36 (SF-36). A cross-sectional study was carried out in 74 pacemaker patients to evaluate validity and reliability of this instrument. Items were selected and scales constructed based on factorial analysis. Internal consistency, content validity and test-retest reliability were moderate to excellent. Correlations with the SF-36 scales, pacing mode and functional tests were as hypothesized, demonstrating the individual value and distinctiveness of the Aquarel subscales. The results support the feasibility and usefulness of evaluating QoL in pacemaker patients when using Aquarel as an extension to the SF-36.},

  abstract = {Variable importance measures for random forests have been receiving increased attention as a means of variable selection in many classification tasks in bioinformatics and related scientific fields, for instance to select a subset of genetic markers relevant for the prediction of a certain disease. We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Random forests are becoming increasingly popular in many scientific fields because they can cope with "small n large p" problems, complex interactions and even highly correlated predictor variables. Their variable importance measures have recently been suggested as screening tools for, e.g., gene expression studies. However, these variable importance measures show a bias towards correlated predictor variables. RESULTS: We identify two mechanisms responsible for this finding: (i) A preference for the selection of correlated predictors in the tree building process and (ii) an additional advantage for correlated predictor variables induced by the unconditional permutation scheme that is employed in the computation of the variable importance measure. Based on these considerations we develop a new, conditional permutation scheme for the computation of the variable importance measure. CONCLUSION: The resulting conditional variable importance reflects the true impact of each predictor variable more reliably than the original marginal approach.},

  abstract = {The recent Stapel fraud case came as a shattering blow to the scientific community of psychologists and damaged both their image in the media and their collective self-esteem. The field responded with suggestions of how fraud could be prevented. However, the Stapel fraud is only one among many cases. Before basing recommendations on one case, it would be informative to study other cases to assess how these frauds were discovered. The authors analyze a convenience sample of fraud cases to see whether (social) psychology is more susceptible to fraud than other disciplines. They also evaluate whether the peer review process and replications work well in practice to detect fraud. There is no evidence that psychology is more vulnerable to fraud than the biomedical sciences, and most frauds are detected through information from whistleblowers with inside information. On the basis of this analysis, the authors suggest a number of strategies that might reduce the risk of scientific fraud.},

This tactic might seem appealing because data collection could be stopped early, which would save valuable resources, if a peek revealed a significant effect. Unfortunately, such data snooping comes with a cost. When the null hypothesis is true, the Type I error rate is inflated, sometimes quite substantially. If the null hypothesis is false, premature significance testing leads to inflated estimates of power and effect size. This program provides simulation results for a wide variety of premature and repeated null hypothesis testing scenarios. It gives researchers the ability to know in advance the consequences of data peeking so that appropriate corrective action can be taken.}

In several studies, community residents reported on problem occurrence and affect several times a day or at the end of the day. We found reliable evidence that persons who scored high (vs. low) in Neuroticism reported more daily problems, tended to react with more severe emotions, experienced more mood spillover from prior occasions, and exhibited stronger reactions to recurring problems (the "neurotic cascade"). The susceptibility of neurotics to stress seems to extend to all types of problems while certain other dimensions of personality (e.g., Agreeableness) are associated with hyperreactivity to particular kinds of problems. The research demonstrates how daily process research can provide insight about classic problems in the field of individual differences.},

However, only recently has it been proposed that the increasing use of personal computers in producing written texts may significantly contribute to the loss of handwriting skills. Such a fundamental change of human habits is likely to have generalized consequences for other basic fine motor skills as well. In this article, the authors provide evidence that the skill to produce precisely controlled arm-hand movements is related to the usage of computer keyboards in producing written text in everyday life. This result supports the notion that specific cultural skills such as handwriting and typing shape more general perceptual and motor skills. More generally, changing technologies are associated with generalized changes of the profile of basic human skills.},

The survey used the tentatively titled “Frankenstein Syndrome Questionnaire” and combined responses both from a Japanese and Western sample in order to explore common, cross-cultural factor structures in these responses. In addition, the differences between samples in terms of relationships between factors as well as other intra-sample relationships were examined. Findings suggest that the Western sample’s interfactor relationships were more structured than the Japanese sample, and that intra-sample characteristics such as age and gender were more prevalent in the Western sample than the Japanese sample. The results are discussed in relation to the notion of the Frankenstein Syndrome advanced by Kaplan [1].},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Previous research has shown a correlation between physician job satisfaction and patient satisfaction with quality of care, but the connection between job satisfaction of other primary care team members and patient satisfaction is yet unclear. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether there is an association between patient satisfaction and job satisfaction of the members of patient care teams. DESIGN The study was based on data from the European Practice Assessment and used an observational design. SETTING 676 primary care practices in Germany. PARTICIPANTS 47\hphantom{,}168 patients, 676 general practitioners (practice principals), 305 physician colleagues (trainees and permanently employed physicians) and 3011 non-physician practice members (nurses, secretaries). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Patient evaluation was measured using the 23-item EUROPEP questionnaire. Job satisfaction was measured using the 10-item Warr-Cook-Wall job satisfaction scale and further items relating to practice structure. Bivariate correlations were applied in which factors of patient satisfaction and practice structure were compared with physicians and non-physicians satisfaction. RESULTS Patient satisfaction correlates positively with the general job satisfaction of the non-physician (r=0.25, p{$<$}0.01) and no significant correlation was found for the general job satisfaction of practice principals and physician colleagues. Patients' satisfaction with the practice organisation correlates positively with the general job satisfaction of the non-physicians (r=0.30, p{$<$}0.01) and their view of practice structure (r=0.29, p{$<$}0.01). CONCLUSIONS The correlation between non-physician team member satisfaction and patient satisfaction was higher than the correlation between satisfaction of physicians and patients. Patients seem to be sensitive to aspects of practice structure.},

  abstract = {The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a widely used screening instrument for depression and anxiety in medically compromised patients. The purpose of this study was to examine the differential item functioning (DIF) of the anxiety subscale of the HADA (HADS-A). A research assistant administered the HADS-A to 166 Chinese patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who were consecutively admitted to a rehabilitation hospital. Although the HADS-A was overall uni-dimensional, there were one mute item and two items with borderline misfit. Only one item had a DIF for arterial oxygen saturation. No item had DIF for other indicators of the severity of COPD. In conclusion, this study found that for one item the HADS-A has significant item bias for the severity of disease in patients with COPD.

  abstract = {Five days of integrative body-mind training (IBMT) improves attention and self-regulation in comparison with the same amount of relaxation training. This paper explores the underlying mechanisms of this finding. We measured the physiological and brain changes at rest before, during, and after 5 days of IBMT and relaxation training. During and after training, the IBMT group showed significantly better physiological reactions in heart rate, respiratory amplitude and rate, and skin conductance response (SCR) than the relaxation control. Differences in heart rate variability (HRV) and EEG power suggested greater involvement of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in the IBMT group during and after training. Imaging data demonstrated stronger subgenual and adjacent ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity in the IBMT group. Frontal midline ACC theta was correlated with high-frequency HRV, suggesting control by the ACC over parasympathetic activity. These results indicate that after 5 days of training, the IBMT group shows better regulation of the ANS by a ventral midfrontal brain system than does the relaxation group. This changed state probably reflects training in the coordination of body and mind given in the IBMT but not in the control group. These results could be useful in the design of further specific interventions.},

The intraclass correlation for a set of classes in which the order of the values is arbitrary (and independent from one class to the next) is a non-negative quantity. Negative estimates are possible and can be interpreted as indicating that the true intraclass correlation is low, that is, two members chosen randomly from any class vary almost as much as any two randomly chosen members of the whole population.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), with postures, breath, relaxation, and meditation, such as Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and yoga, are complex interventions increasingly used for trauma-related psychiatric conditions. Prior reviews have adopted a disorder-specific focus. However, trauma is a risk factor for most psychiatric conditions. We adopted a transdiagnostic approach to evaluate the efficacy of MBIs for the consequences of trauma, agnostic to diagnosis. AMED, CINAHL, Central, Embase, Pubmed/Medline, PsycINFO, and Scopus were searched to 30 September 2018 for controlled and uncontrolled trials of mindfulness, yoga, tai chi, and qi gong in people specifically selected for trauma exposure. Of {$>$}12,000 results, 66 studies were included in the systematic review and 24 controlled studies were meta-analyzed. There was a significant, pooled effect of MBIs (g = 0.51, 95\%CI 0.31 to 0.71, p {$<$} .001). Similar effects were observed for mindfulness (g = 0.45, 0.26 to 0.64, p {$<$} .001), yoga (g = 0.46, 0.26 to 0.66, p {$<$} .001), and integrative exercise (g = 0.94, 0.37 to 1.51, p = .001), with no difference between interventions. Outcome measure or trauma type did not influence the effectiveness, but interventions of 8 weeks or more were more effective than shorter interventions (Q = 8.39, df = 2, p = .02). Mindfulness-based interventions, adjunctive to treatment-as-usual of medication and/or psychotherapy, are effective in reducing trauma-related symptoms. Yoga and mindfulness have comparable effectiveness. Many psychiatric studies do not report trauma exposure, focusing on disorder-specific outcomes, but this review suggests a transdiagnostic approach could be adopted in the treatment of trauma sequelae with MBIs. More rigorous reporting of trauma exposure and MBI treatment protocols is recommended to enhance future research.},

Social movements and internal problems of traditional psychology are identified as factors in the rise of his psychology, whereas the decline of Critical Psychology in the 1980s and 1990s is attributed to social development, limitations of a systematic-foundational framework, and the emergence of alternative critical approaches. Despite these problems the article shows that Holzkamp is an eminent theoretical psychologist who has made significant contributions to psychological knowledge.},

What has been lacking, however, is an understanding of the mechanism underlying this effect. Some theorists have described mindfulness as embodying two facets-present moment awareness and emotional acceptance. Here, we examine how the effect of meditation practice on executive control manifests in the brain, suggesting that emotional acceptance and performance monitoring play important roles. We investigated the effect of meditation practice on executive control and measured the neural correlates of performance monitoring, specifically, the error-related negativity (ERN), a neurophysiological response that occurs within 100 ms of error commission. Meditators and controls completed a Stroop task, during which we recorded ERN amplitudes with electroencephalography. Meditators showed greater executive control (i.e. fewer errors), a higher ERN and more emotional acceptance than controls. Finally, mediation pathway models further revealed that meditation practice relates to greater executive control and that this effect can be accounted for by heightened emotional acceptance, and to a lesser extent, increased brain-based performance monitoring.},

  abstract = {Evidence for situational specificity of personality-job performance relations calls for better understanding of how personality is expressed as valued work behavior. On the basis of an interactionist principle of trait activation (R. P. Tett \& H. A. Guterman, 2000), a model is proposed that distinguishes among 5 situational features relevant to trait expression (job demands, distracters, constraints, releasers, and facilitators), operating at task, social, and organizational levels. Trait-expressive work behavior is distinguished from (valued) job performance in clarifying the conditions favoring personality use in selection efforts. The model frames linkages between situational taxonomies (e.g., J. L. Holland's [1985] RIASEC model) and the Big Five and promotes useful discussion of critical issues, including situational specificity, personality-oriented job analysis, team building, and work motivation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the present paper, we describe a model of neurovisceral integration in which a set of neural structures involved in cognitive, affective, and autonomic regulation are related to heart rate variability (HRV) and cognitive performance. METHODS: We detail the pathways involved in the neural regulation of the cardiovascular system and provide pharmacological and neuroimaging data in support of the neural structures linking the central nervous system to HRV in humans. We review a number of studies from our group showing that individual differences in HRV are related to performance on tasks associated with executive function and prefrontal cortical activity. These studies include comparisons of executive- and nonexecutive-function tasks in healthy participants, in both threatening and nonthreatening conditions. In addition, we show that manipulating resting HRV levels is associated with changes in performance on executive-function tasks. We also examine the relationship between HRV and cognitive performance in ecologically valid situations using a police shooting simulation and a naval navigation simulation. Finally, we review our studies in anxiety patients, as well as studies examining psychopathy. CONCLUSION: These findings in total suggest an important relationship among cognitive performance, HRV, and prefrontal neural function that has important implications for both physical and mental health. Future studies are needed to determine exactly which executive functions are associated with individual differences in HRV in a wider range of situations and populations.},

The aim of the present study was to develop a sensitive, valid and reliable measure of patient satisfaction. This paper describes the first phase of the study, the development of a multidimensional concept of satisfaction from the patients' perspective. Using qualitative methods, patients were interviewed both in hospital and following discharge. Eleven main concepts were identified: nurses' manner, attentiveness, availability, reassurance, individual treatment, openness/informality, information, professionalism, ward organization, nurses' knowledge and ward environment. Beginning with customer-defined values has provided the starting point for the development of a scale to measure patients' satisfaction with nursing using concepts important to patients, rather than hospital personnel or research teams.},

An important task related to this purpose was the validation of the constructs and their stability from pre- to postintervention measures. Data from 1,136 middle grade students were obtained from an earlier evaluation of an abstinence-based teen pregnancy prevention program (S. Weed, I. Ericksen, G. Grant, \& A. Lewis, 2002). Latent trait structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the impact of the intervention program on changes in constructs of teens' attitudes toward sexuality. Gender was also taken into consideration. This investigation provides credible evidence that both 1st- and 2nd-order constructs related to measures of teens' attitudes toward risky sexual behavior are sufficiently stable and sensitive to detect program effects.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have previously studied prospective associations between computer use and mental health symptoms in a selected young adult population. The purpose of this study was to investigate if high computer use is a prospective risk factor for developing mental health symptoms in a population-based sample of young adults. METHODS: The study group was a cohort of young adults (n = 4163), 20-24 years old, who responded to a questionnaire at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Exposure variables included time spent on computer use (CU) in general, email/chat use, computer gaming, CU without breaks, and CU at night causing lost sleep. Mental health outcomes included perceived stress, sleep disturbances, symptoms of depression, and reduced performance due to stress, depressed mood, or tiredness. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated for prospective associations between exposure variables at baseline and mental health outcomes (new cases) at 1-year follow-up for the men and women separately. RESULTS: Both high and medium computer use compared to low computer use at baseline were associated with sleep disturbances in the men at follow-up. High email/chat use was negatively associated with perceived stress, but positively associated with reported sleep disturbances for the men. For the women, high email/chat use was (positively) associated with several mental health outcomes, while medium computer gaming was associated with symptoms of depression, and CU without breaks with most mental health outcomes. CU causing lost sleep was associated with mental health outcomes for both men and women. CONCLUSIONS: Time spent on general computer use was prospectively associated with sleep disturbances and reduced performance for the men. For the women, using the computer without breaks was a risk factor for several mental health outcomes. Some associations were enhanced in interaction with mobile phone use. Using the computer at night and consequently losing sleep was associated with most mental health outcomes for both men and women. Further studies should focus on mechanisms relating information and communication technology (ICT) use to sleep disturbances.},

Die Theorie und das Konzept der Scham als Affekt, das in der klassischen Psychoanalyse verankert ist, wird dabei im Lichte der modernen Intersubjektivitätstheorie und -Forschung entworfen. Aus dieser intersubjektiven Sichtweise heraus besteht die Hauptthese darin, dass Scham in erster Linie als ein intersubjektives Geschehen zu konzeptuallisieren ist, nicht als intrasubjektives Geschehen. Dies wird auch durch eine besondere Eigenschaft der Scham, ihre ansteckende Natur deutlich. Was die Verortung der Scham angeht, wird postuliert, dass Scham als Affekt nicht einfach im Selbst eines Menschen wurzelt, d.h. subjektive Bedeutung besitzt. Scham geht auch nicht primär nur aus inneren Motiven (v.a. exhibitionistischen Motiven) hervor, sondern muss als ein Relikt einer interpersonalen Situation der Beschämung und Demütigung angesehen werden, als Erleben fehlender intersubjektiver Anerkennung. Diese wird als Zurückweisung, Missachtung und im schlimmsten Fall als Verworfensein und Ausgestoßensein empfunden und erlitten. Der abwertende, verachtende oder nicht resonierende Blick ist die entscheidende Komponente dabei.},

Seventy-nine consecutive admissions to three intermediate care facilities were evaluated. Twenty-five of the subjects became recurrent fallers. The nine risk factors included in the fall risk index were mobility score, morale score, mental status score, distant vision, hearing, postural blood pressure, results of back examination, postadmission medications, and admission activities of daily living score. A subject's fall risk score was the number of index factors present. The proportions of recurrent falters increased from 0 percent (0 of 30) in those with 0 to three risk factors, to 31 percent (11 of 35) in those with four to six factors, to 100 percent (14 of 14) in those with seven or more factors. Falling, at least among some elderly persons, appears to result from the accumulated effect of multiple specific disabilities. Some of these disabilities may be remediable. The mobility test, the best single predictor of recurrent falling, may be useful clinically because it is simple, recreates fall situations, and provides a dynamic, integrated assessment of mobility.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {The recent simulation-based inference (SBI) movement in algebra-based introductory statistics courses (Stat 101) has provided preliminary evidence of improved student conceptual understanding and retention. However, little is known about whether these positive effects are preferentially distributed across types of students entering the course. We consider how two metrics of Stat 101 student preparation (precourse performance on concept inventory and math ACT score) may or may not be associated with end of course student performance on conceptual inventories. Students across all preparation levels tended to show improvement in Stat 101, but more improvement was observed across all student preparation levels in early versions of a SBI course. Furthermore, students' gains tended to be similar regardless of whether students entered the course with more preparation or less. Recent data on a sample of students using a current version of an SBI course showed similar results, though direct comparison with non-SBI students was not possible. Overall, our analysis provides additional evidence that SBI curricula are effective at improving students' conceptual understanding of statistical ideas postcourse regardless student preparation. Further work is needed to better understand nuances of student improvement based on other student demographics, prior coursework as well as instructor and institutional variables.},

The impact of this research has started to change course content and structure, in both introductory and advanced courses for statisticians and those from other disciplines. In the light of these changes future directions in the teaching and learning of statistics must take into account new innovative pedagogical instructions, educational technologies and the abundance of Web resources that are now available. This article examines different aspects of currently identified challenges in the teaching and learning of statistics and gives an overview of useful strategies and innovations for developing research-based statistics courses in the context of recommendations for reforms, outlining the place of information technology within this framework. The article presents a review of the literature on the topic of statistics education and gives instructors a set of guidelines for generating new and effective teaching material. The summarised recommendations incorporate many innovations employed in a variety of successful statistics classes today.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify specific patient satisfaction items related to overall satisfaction by different length of stay (LOS) for patients in Japanese hospital settings. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved a participant sample, drawn from 77 voluntarily participating hospitals throughout Japan, of in-patients discharged to the community. Older patients and psychiatric, pediatric, obstetric and gynecologic patients were excluded. The 1050 respondents analyzed (response rate {$>$} or = 5l.1\%) were divided into three groups based on their LOS: group 1, LOS {$<$} or = 1 week; group 2, LOS {$<$} or = 1 month; and group 3, LOS {$>$} 1 month. Using stepwise multiple regression analysis, we explored for each LOS group the relationship between overall patient satisfaction and satisfaction with 33 individual items, including three regarding perceived reputation of the hospital in question. RESULTS: Some unique satisfaction items for each group (e.g. 'skill of nursing care' in group 1, 'Recovery of physical health', 'skill of nursing care', and 'respect for patients opinions and feelings' in group 2, and 'relief from pain' and 'respect for patients' opinions and feelings' in group 3) were significantly associated with overall satisfaction. In all three groups, common items (e.g. 'recovery from distress and anxiety' and 'doctor's clinical competence') also related significantly to overall satisfaction. Two items pertaining to the hospital reputation dimension (e.g. 'family member's evaluation of the hospital' and 'hospital reputation among other patients') were also significant predictors of overall satisfaction in all three groups. CONCLUSION: The findings show that according to LOS, unique items could determine significantly the achievement of overall satisfaction, while some common predictors across all three LOS groupings also seemed to be indispensable for inpatient's assessment of hospital care. It was also confirmed in this study that a positive perception of hospital reputation might have an important role in patient satisfaction in Japan.},

  abstract = {Introduction. Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease and mainly caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). It has been one of the major causes of mortality in Ethiopia. The objective of the study was to identify factors that affect the survival of the patients with tuberculosis who started treatment for tuberculosis. Methods. This was a retrospective study in six randomly selected health centres in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The data were obtained from medical records of TB patients registered from September 2012 to August 2013 and treated under directly observed treatment surgery (DOTS) strategy. Kaplan Meier plots, logrank tests, and Wilcoxon tests were used to assess the survival pattern. Cox proportional hazards model for multivariable analysis was discussed. Results. Out of the total 826 registered TB patients, 105 (12.71\%) died during the study period and 712 (87.29\%) were censored. Based on Kaplan Meier survival curves, logrank test, and Wilcoxon test, it was found that the patients had statistically significant differences in survival experience with respect to age, body weight at initiation of treatment, TB patient category, and HIV status. Multivariable Cox hazards regression analysis revealed that the covariates age, TB patient category, HIV, and age by HIV interaction were significant risk factors associated with death status in TB patients. Conclusion. Deaths of individuals with diseases especially HIV coinfected and nonnew TB cases were high. Therefore, this needs to strengthen the follow-up of patients with TB treatment from the day of anti-TB treatment initiation to completion days.},

  abstract = {During binocular rivalry, conflicting monocular images compete for access to consciousness in a stochastic, dynamical fashion. Recent human neuroimaging and psychophysical studies suggest that rivalry entails competitive interactions at multiple neural sites, including sites that retain eye-selective information. Rivalry greatly suppresses activity in the ventral pathway and attenuates visual adaptation to form and motion; nonetheless, some information about the suppressed stimulus reaches higher brain areas. Although rivalry depends on low-level inhibitory interactions, high-level excitatory influences promoting perceptual grouping and selective attention can extend the local dominance of a stimulus over space and time. Inhibitory and excitatory circuits considered within a hybrid model might account for the paradoxical properties of binocular rivalry and provide insights into the neural bases of visual awareness itself.},

Science becomes science, however, only when this question is justified and the appropriate methodology is chosen for answering the research question. Research question should precede the other questions; methods should be chosen according to the research question and not vice versa. Modern quantitative psychology has accepted method as primary; research questions are adjusted to the methods. For understanding thinking in modern quantitative psychology, two epistemologies should be distinguished: structural-systemic that is based on Aristotelian thinking, and associative-quantitative that is based on Cartesian-Humean thinking. The first aims at understanding the structure that underlies the studied processes; the second looks for identification of cause-effect relationships between the events with no possible access to the understanding of the structures that underlie the processes. Quantitative methodology in particular as well as mathematical psychology in general, is useless for answering questions about structures and processes that underlie observed behaviors. Nevertheless, quantitative science is almost inevitable in a situation where the systemic-structural basis of behavior is not well understood; all sorts of applied decisions can be made on the basis of quantitative studies. In order to proceed, psychology should study structures; methodologically, constructive experiments should be added to observations and analytic experiments.},

It is a prime measure of the miserly information processing posited by most dual process theories. The original three-item test may be becoming known to potential participants, however. We examined a four-item version that could serve as a substitute for the original. Our data show that it displays a .58 correlation with the original version and that it has very similar relationships with cognitive ability, various thinking dispositions, and with several other rational thinking tasks. Combining the two versions into a seven-item test resulted in a measure of miserly processing with substantial reliability (.72). The seven-item version was a strong independent predictor of performance on rational thinking tasks after the variance accounted for by cognitive ability and thinking dispositions had been partialled out.

  abstract = {We integrate dual-process theories of human cognition with evolutionary game theory to study the evolution of automatic and controlled decision-making processes. We introduce a model where agents who make decisions using either automatic or controlled processing compete with each other for survival. Agents using automatic processing act quickly and so are more likely to acquire resources, but agents using controlled processing are better planners and so make more effective use of the resources they have. Using the replicator equation, we characterize the conditions under which automatic or controlled agents dominate, when coexistence is possible, and when bistability occurs. We then extend the replicator equation to consider feedback between the state of the population and the environment. Under conditions where having a greater proportion of controlled agents either enriches the environment or enhances the competitive advantage of automatic agents, we find that limit cycles can occur, leading to persistent oscillations in the population dynamics. Critically, however, these limit cycles only emerge when feedback occurs on a sufficiently long time scale. Our results shed light on the connection between evolution and human cognition, and demonstrate necessary conditions for the rise and fall of rationality.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Valid instruments to measure practitioners' attitudes towards clinical practice guidelines need to be developed. However, few of the available instruments have been thoroughly validated.: To adapt into French and to test the reliability and validity of a scale for measurement of attitudes towards guidelines developed by Elovainio et al.: A 27-item scale (divided into six dimensions) measuring attitudes towards guidelines was translated into French by two English native translators, reviewed and finalized by expert committee and administered to 314 practitioners who agreed to participate. Main practitioners' characteristics were collected. Item and dimension reproducibility were assessed for 62 practitioners by calculation of intraclass correlation coefficients. Internal construct validity was assessed by principal components analyses. Convergent and discriminant validity were analysed.: Item response rates ranged from 82 to 100\%. In the test-retest procedure, intraclass correlation coefficients for separate items ranged from 0.1 to 0.7 and those for dimensions were 0.7 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.5-0.8] for usefulness, 0.5 (0.3-0.6) for reliability, 0.4 (0.2-0.5) for individual competence, 0.5 (0.3-0.6) for organizational competence, 0.7 (0.5-0.8) for impracticality and 0.4 (0.3-0.6) for availability. The factorial structure after Varimax rotation showed that none of the different solutions obtained had a strictly comparable structure to that of the original scale. External construct validity was satisfactory.: This scale does not have satisfactory psychometric properties and therefore cannot confidently be used in future research assessing whether attitudes towards guidelines are a determining factor in physicians' compliance with guidelines. More research is needed to develop valid scales in a more rigorous procedure, involving qualitative and quantitative steps.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a questionnaire, in Spanish, for assessing patient satisfaction with pharmaceutical care received in community pharmacies. DESIGN: Selection and translation of questionnaire's items; definition of response scale and demographic questions. Evaluation of face and content validity, feasibility, factor structure, reliability and construct validity. SETTING: Forty-one community pharmacies of the province of Santa Fe. Argentina. PARTICIPANTS: Questionnaire administered to patients receiving pharmaceutical care or traditional pharmacy services. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Pilot test to assess feasibility. Factor analysis used principal components and varimax rotation. Reliability established using internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha. Construct validity determined with extreme group method. RESULTS: A self-administered questionnaire with 27 items, 5-point Likert response scale and demographic questions was designed considering multidimensional structure of patient satisfaction. Questionnaire evaluates cumulative experience of patients with comprehensive pharmaceutical care practice in community pharmacies. Two hundred and seventy-four complete questionnaires were obtained. Factor analysis resulted in three factors: Managing therapy, Interpersonal relationship and General satisfaction, with a cumulative variance of 62.51\%. Cronbach's alpha for the whole questionnaire was 0.96, and 0.95, 0.88 and 0.76 for the three factors, respectively. Mann-Whitney test for construct validity did not showed significant differences between pharmacies that provide pharmaceutical care and those that do not, however, 23 items showed significant differences between the two groups of pharmacies. CONCLUSION: The questionnaire developed can be a reliable and valid instrument to assess patient satisfaction with pharmaceutical care in community pharmacies in Spanish. Further research is needed to deepen the validation process.},

Kyngdon's response is of particular interest, since he asserts that measurement may already have been established. If correct, it would definitely invalidate any quantity objection and end the century-long discussion about the measurability of psychological attributes. Therefore the focus of the rejoinder will be on the question of when measurement is reached. First the meaning of measurement is elaborated. On this basis, criteria for the successful establishment of measurement are formulated and it is outlined how these are satisfied in the case of intensive quantities. It is concluded that the evidence presented by Kyngdon is insufficient and inadequate. The approach will also serve as background to discuss objections raised against the Millean Quantity Objection.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a concise scale for measuring outpatient satisfaction suitable across specialties and cultures. DESIGN: \& SETTING: Item generation adopted a concept-driven approach, and 10 candidate items were administered together with a battery of validation items and scales in a cross-sectional survey at a government-aided Chinese medicine specialized outpatient department in Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: About 344 consenting patients or their accompanying caregivers were recruited upon their first visit at the clinic and interviewed one month thereafter. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 79\%. After deleting one item (physician's manner and attitude) for its redundancy suggested by interitem correlations, exploratory factor analysis yielded two factors, General Service and Case Physician, explaining 75\% of variance of the remaining nine items. The internal consistency coefficients of the whole scale and the two subscales were higher than 0.90. Criterion-related validity was supported by high correlations with three anchor items, overall satisfaction, intended future reutilization, and recommendation to others (r = 0.38-0.85). Significant correlations with compliance and negative affects provided preliminary evidence for construct validity. CONCLUSION: The psychometric properties of the resulting 9-item scale supported its usefulness in measuring outpatient satisfaction. Further validation studies in various specialties and countries are suggested to make future cross-cultural comparisons possible.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence-based medicine is valuable to the extent that the evidence base is complete and unbiased. Selective publication of clinical trials--and the outcomes within those trials--can lead to unrealistic estimates of drug effectiveness and alter the apparent risk-benefit ratio. METHODS: We obtained reviews from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for studies of 12 antidepressant agents involving 12,564 patients. We conducted a systematic literature search to identify matching publications. For trials that were reported in the literature, we compared the published outcomes with the FDA outcomes. We also compared the effect size derived from the published reports with the effect size derived from the entire FDA data set. RESULTS: Among 74 FDA-registered studies, 31\%, accounting for 3449 study participants, were not published. Whether and how the studies were published were associated with the study outcome. A total of 37 studies viewed by the FDA as having positive results were published; 1 study viewed as positive was not published. Studies viewed by the FDA as having negative or questionable results were, with 3 exceptions, either not published (22 studies) or published in a way that, in our opinion, conveyed a positive outcome (11 studies). According to the published literature, it appeared that 94\% of the trials conducted were positive. By contrast, the FDA analysis showed that 51\% were positive. Separate meta-analyses of the FDA and journal data sets showed that the increase in effect size ranged from 11 to 69\% for individual drugs and was 32\% overall. CONCLUSIONS: We cannot determine whether the bias observed resulted from a failure to submit manuscripts on the part of authors and sponsors, from decisions by journal editors and reviewers not to publish, or both. Selective reporting of clinical trial results may have adverse consequences for researchers, study participants, health care professionals, and patients.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT This study expanded the State Mindfulness Scale for Physical Activity (SMS-PA) to include acceptance items to better represent core elements of mindfulness. Young adults who just participated in physical activity (N = 394) completed a survey to assess state mindfulness and theoretically relevant constructs about affect, motivation, and body image. An exploratory factor analysis was used to reduce the item pool on half of the sample. A 19-item and 15-item version of the SMS-PA2 were further tested through confirmatory factor analysis on the second half of the sample demonstrating a theoretically based factor structure representing either a total score or four separate factors – monitoring of the mind and body and accepting of the mind and body. The SMS-PA2 scores demonstrated evidence supporting construct and incremental validity through associations with theoretically relevant variables. Initial evidence shows expanded predictive utility of the SMS-PA2.},

Shorter time in bed during weekdays, and later weekend sleeping hours correlate with smaller brain grey matter volumes in frontal, anterior cingulate, and precuneus cortex regions. Poor school grade average associates with later weekend bedtime and smaller grey matter volumes in medial brain regions. The medial prefrontal - anterior cingulate cortex appears most tightly related to the adolescents' variations in sleep habits, as its volume correlates inversely with both weekend bedtime and wake up time, and also with poor school performance. These findings suggest that sleep habits, notably during the weekends, have an alarming link with both the structure of the adolescent brain and school performance, and thus highlight the need for informed interventions.},

The key evidence cited in support of this belief are meta-analyses of multisection studies showing small-to-moderate correlations between SET ratings and student achievement (e.g., Cohen, 1980, Cohen, 1981; Feldman, 1989). We re-analyzed previously published meta-analyses of the multisection studies and found that their findings were an artifact of small sample sized studies and publication bias. Whereas the small sample sized studies showed large and moderate correlation, the large sample sized studies showed no or only minimal correlation between SET ratings and learning. Our up-to-date meta-analysis of all multisection studies revealed no significant correlations between the SET ratings and learning. These findings suggest that institutions focused on student learning and career success may want to abandon SET ratings as a measure of faculty's teaching effectiveness.},

A statistically significant correlation was observed between dominant shoulder internal rotation deficits and shoulder pain. Also observed was a statistically significant correlation between lead hip internal rotation deficits and lumbar extension deficits with LBP. We conclude that due to repetitive demands on the dominant shoulder and repetitive pivoting at the lead hip, the cycle of microtrauma and scar formation leads to capsular contracture and subsequent reduction in internal range of motion. It is likely that the limitation in lumbar extension in the symptomatic group is not only due to decreased flexibility from an increased load on the spine, but also due to a protective mechanism to prevent further exacerbation of the LBP. Physical conditioning that includes shoulder as well as hip internal rotation stretching programs should therefore be essential aspects in the treatment of tennis players with shoulder pain and LBP respectively.}

False negatives are particularly concerning in research areas where demonstrating the absence of an effect is crucial, such as studies of unconscious or implicit processing. Research on implicit processes seeks evidence of above-chance performance on some implicit behavioral measure at the same time as chance-level performance (that is, a null result) on an explicit measure of awareness. A systematic review of 73 studies of contextual cuing, a popular implicit learning paradigm, involving 181 statistical analyses of awareness tests, reveals how underpowered studies can lead to failure to reject a false null hypothesis. Among the studies that reported sufficient information, the meta-analytic effect size across awareness tests was d z = 0.31 (95~\% CI 0.24-0.37), showing that participants' learning in these experiments was conscious. The unusually large number of positive results in this literature cannot be explained by selective publication. Instead, our analyses demonstrate that these tests are typically insensitive and underpowered to detect medium to small, but true, effects in awareness tests. These findings challenge a widespread and theoretically important claim about the extent of unconscious human cognition.},

The phenomenological analysis of the multiple ASC resulted in 4 dimensions by which they can be characterized: activation, awareness span, self-awareness, and sensory dynamics. The neurophysiological approach revealed that the different states of consciousness are mainly brought about by a compromised brain structure, transient changes in brain dynamics (disconnectivity), and neurochemical and metabolic processes. Besides these severe alterations, environmental stimuli, mental practices, and techniques of self-control can also temporarily alter brain functioning and conscious experience.},

Reporting on past conscious experience is inherently tricky and presents unique challenges to the assessment of mindfulness. Mindfulness-present and mindfulness-absent items may represent different aspects of the construct to different populations resulting from differential skill in assessing sustained or lapsed conscious attention. The current study shows that an online sample of meditators and non-meditators with similar overall levels of mindfulness differentially endorse response options for positively and negatively worded items. While meditators endorse mindfulness-present and mindfulness-absent items with nearly equivalent frequency, student non-meditators are much more likely to reject mindfulness-absent items than to accept mindfulness-present items. The differential item functioning between these two groups represents a potential problem regarding construct validity when comparing meditators to non-meditators and when assessing mindfulness as a pre-post measure with meditation practice.},

  abstract = {The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) is one of the most popular measures of mindfulness, exhibiting promising psychometric properties and theoretically consistent relationships to brain activity, mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) outcomes, and mediation of MBI effects. The present study investigated the response patterns and scale properties in a large sample of undergraduate students (N= 414) using Item Response Theory analyses. The findings suggest that general statements of " automatic inattentiveness" or " automatic pilot" confer greater statistical information about the underlying latent trait. Evidence of limited abilities to report on mindlessness and of response bias to " mindfulness-absent" items suggests challenges to the construct validity of the MAAS. The current findings, along with pre-existing data, suggest that reverse-scoring the scale may be inadequate to represent intentional attention or awareness. Further research is needed to determine which variations, components, and correlates of the numerous operationalizations of mindfulness are theoretically consistent and most salient to positive outcomes, especially in psychopathology. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The aim of this study was to investigate whether acceptance is also associated with better well-being in patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).Methods Ninety-seven patients completed a battery of questionnaires measuring fatigue, functional impairment, psychological distress, and acceptance.Results Results indicated that acceptance has a positive effect upon fatigue and psychological aspects of well-being. More specifically, acceptance was related to more emotional stability and less psychological distress, beyond the effects of demographic variables, and fatigue severity.Conclusion We suggest that promoting acceptance in patients with CFS may often be more beneficial than trying to control largely uncontrollable symptoms.},

  abstract = {Background Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and its prevalence is on the rise. One of the most debilitating aspects of depression is the dominance and persistence of depressive rumination, a state of mind that is linked to onset and recurrence of depression. Mindfulness meditation trains adaptive attention regulation and present-moment embodied awareness, skills that may be particularly useful during depressive mind states characterized by negative ruminative thoughts. Methods In a randomized controlled functional magnetic resonance imaging study (N~= 80), we looked at the neurocognitive mechanisms behind mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (n~= 50) for recurrent depression compared with treatment as usual (n~= 30) across experimentally induced states of rest, mindfulness practice and rumination, and the relationship with dispositional psychological processes. Results Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy compared with treatment as usual led to decreased salience network connectivity to the lingual gyrus during a ruminative state, and this change in salience network connectivity mediated improvements in the ability to sustain and control attention to body sensations. Conclusions These findings showed that a clinically effective mindfulness intervention modulates neurocognitive functioning~during depressive rumination and the ability to sustain attention to the body.},

Traditional approaches to mediation in the biomedical and social sciences are described. Attention is given to the confounding assumptions required for a causal interpretation of direct and indirect effect estimates. Methods from the causal inference literature to conduct mediation in the presence of exposure-mediator interactions, binary outcomes, binary mediators, and case-control study designs are presented. Sensitivity analysis techniques for unmeasured confounding and measurement error are introduced. Discussion is given to extensions to time-to-event outcomes and multiple mediators. Further flexible modeling strategies arising from the precise counterfactual definitions of direct and indirect effects are also described. The focus throughout is on methodology that is easily implementable in practice across a broad range of potential applications.},

Study participants: European Pathway Association (E-P-A) contact persons in 23 countries. Results: Clinical pathways, also known as critical pathways or integrated care pathways, have been used in health care for 20 years. Although clinical pathways are well established, little information exists on their use and dissemination around the world. The E-P-A has performed their first international survey on the use and dissemination of clinical pathways in 23 countries. At present, pathways are used with a minority of patients, mainly in acute hospital trusts. Our survey showed that clinical pathways were predominantly viewed as a ultidisciplinary tool to improve the quality and efficiency of evidence-based care. Pathways were also used as a communication tool between professionals to manage and standardize outcome-oriented care. Conclusions: There is a future for the use of clinical pathways, but there is a need for international benchmarking and knowledge sharing with regard to their development, implementation and evaluation.}

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive method guidelines. OBJECTIVES: To help reviewers design, conduct, and report reviews of trials in the field of back and neck pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In 1997, the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group published method guidelines for systematic reviews. Since its publication, new methodologic evidence emerged and more experience was acquired in conducting reviews. METHODS: All reviews and protocols of the Back Review Group were assessed for compliance with the 1997 method guidelines. Also, the most recent version of the Cochrane Handbook (4.1) was checked for new recommendations. In addition, some important topics that were not addressed in the 1997 method guidelines were included (e.g., methods for qualitative analysis, reporting of conclusions, and discussion of clinical relevance of the results). In May 2002, preliminary results were presented and discussed in a workshop. In two rounds, a list of all possible recommendations and the final draft were circulated for comments among the editors of the Back Review Group. RESULTS: The recommendations are divided in five categories: literature search, inclusion criteria, methodologic quality assessment, data extraction, and data analysis. Each recommendation is classified in minimum criteria and further guidance. Additional recommendations are included regarding assessment of clinical relevance, and reporting of results and conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic reviews need to be conducted as carefully as the trials they report and, to achieve full impact, systematic reviews need to meet high methodologic standards.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ability to estimate the passage of time is of fundamental importance for perceptual and cognitive processes. One experience of time is the perception of duration, which is not isomorphic to physical duration and can be distorted by a number of factors. Yet, the critical features generating these perceptual shifts in subjective duration are not understood. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: We used prospective duration judgments within and across sensory modalities to examine the effect of stimulus predictability and feature change on the perception of duration. First, we found robust distortions of perceived duration in auditory, visual and auditory-visual presentations despite the predictability of the feature changes in the stimuli. For example, a looming disc embedded in a series of steady discs led to time dilation, whereas a steady disc embedded in a series of looming discs led to time compression. Second, we addressed whether visual (auditory) inputs could alter the perception of duration of auditory (visual) inputs. When participants were presented with incongruent audio-visual stimuli, the perceived duration of auditory events could be shortened or lengthened by the presence of conflicting visual information; however, the perceived duration of visual events was seldom distorted by the presence of auditory information and was never perceived shorter than their actual durations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results support the existence of multisensory interactions in the perception of duration and, importantly, suggest that vision can modify auditory temporal perception in a pure timing task. Insofar as distortions in subjective duration can neither be accounted for by the unpredictability of an auditory, visual or auditory-visual event, we propose that it is the intrinsic features of the stimulus that critically affect subjective time distortions.},

Try this for yourself: take a quick glance at the second hand of a clock. Immediately, the tick will pause momentarily and appear to be longer than the subsequent ticks. Yet, they all last exactly one second. By and large, a deviant or an unexpected stimulus in a series of similar events (same duration, same features) can elicit a relative overestimation of subjective time (or "time dilation") but, as is shown here, this is not always the case. We conducted an event-related functional magnetic neuroimaging (fMRI) study on the time dilation effect. Participants were presented with a series of five visual discs, all static and of equal duration (standards) except for the fourth one, a looming or a receding target. The duration of the target was systematically varied and participants judged whether it was shorter or longer than all other standards in the sequence. Subjective time dilation was observed for the looming stimulus but not for the receding one, which was estimated to be of equal duration to the standards. The neural activation for targets (looming and receding) contrasted with the standards revealed an increased activation of the anterior insula and of the anterior cingulate cortex. Contrasting the looming with the receding targets (i.e. capturing the time dilation effect proper) revealed a specific activation of cortical midline structures. The implication of midline structures in the time dilation illusion is here interpreted in the context of self-referential processes.},

We hypothesized that implicit-explicit self-esteem discrepancies foster autoaggressive behavior and dysphoria, and impair self-perception. We found that the two forms of self-esteem discrepancies, damaged and fragile self-esteem were related to the severity of overall borderline symptoms, autoaggression, dysphoria, and deficits in self-perception. In contrast, more general psychopathological impairment, such as depression, was not related to self-esteem discrepancies. Taken together our results indicate that discrepancies between explicit and implicit self-esteem are associated with certain borderline symptoms that may be based on internal tension. The findings can be interpreted within the framework of self-discrepancies and dichotomous attitudes in patients with BPD. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Mean quality did not improve in recent years. Pooled standardized mean differences using the random-effect model were calculated to represent the average intervention effect and, to perform subgroup analyses. Outcome measures were pain intensity, depression, anxiety, pain interference, disability and quality of life. Included were twenty-five RCTs totaling 1285 patients with chronic pain, in which we compared acceptance- and mindfulness-based interventions to the waitlist, (medical) treatment-as-usual, and education or support control groups. Effect sizes ranged from small (on all outcome measures except anxiety and pain interference) to moderate (on anxiety and pain interference) at post-treatment and from small (on pain intensity and disability) to large (on pain interference) at follow-up. ACT showed significantly higher effects on depression and anxiety than MBSR and MBCT. Studies' quality, attrition rate, type of pain and control group, did not moderate the effects of acceptance- and mindfulness-based interventions. Current acceptance- and mindfulness-based interventions, while not superior to traditional cognitive behavioral treatments, can be good alternatives.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The investigation of treatment mechanisms in randomized controlled trials has considerable clinical and theoretical relevance. Despite the empirical support for the effect of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in the treatment of recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD), the specific mechanisms by which MBCT leads to therapeutic change remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: By means of a systematic review we evaluate how the field is progressing in its empirical investigation of mechanisms of change in MBCT for recurrent MDD. METHOD: To identify relevant studies, a systematic search was conducted. Studies were coded and ranked for quality. RESULTS: The search produced 476 articles, of which 23 were included. In line with the theoretical premise, 12 studies found that alterations in mindfulness, rumination, worry, compassion, or meta-awareness were associated with, predicted or mediated MBCT's effect on treatment outcome. In addition, preliminary studies indicated that alterations in attention, memory specificity, self-discrepancy, emotional reactivity and momentary positive and negative affect might play a role in how MBCT exerts its clinical effects. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that MBCT could work through some of the MBCT model's theoretically predicted mechanisms. However, there is a need for more rigorous designs that can assess greater levels of causal specificity.},

  abstract = {Prior research has provided valuable insights into how and why employees make a decision about the adoption and use of information technologies (ITs) in the workplace. From an organizational point of view, however, the more important issue is how managers make informed decisions about interventions that can lead to greater acceptance and effective utilization of IT. There is limited research in the IT implementation literature that deals with the role of interventions to aid such managerial decision making. Particularly, there is a need to understand how various interventions can influence the known determinants of IT adoption and use. To address this gap in the literature, we draw from the vast body of research on the technology acceptance model (TAM), particularly the work on the determinants of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, and: (i) develop a comprehensive nomological network (integrated model) of the determinants of individual level (IT) adoption and use; (ii) empirically test the proposed integrated model; and (iii) present a research agenda focused on potential pre- and postimplementation interventions that can enhance employees' adoption and use of IT. Our findings and research agenda have important implications for managerial decision making on IT implementation in organizations.}

  abstract = {Quitting smoking is a major life stressor that results in numerous aversive consequences, including persistently increased level of post-cessation negative affect and relapse. The identification of factors that may enhance behavioral and emotional regulation after quitting may be useful in enhancing quit rates and preventing relapse. One factor broadly linked with behavioral and emotional regulation is mindfulness. This study examined baseline associations of mindfulness with demographic variables, smoking history, dependence, withdrawal severity, and agency among 158 smokers enrolled in a cessation trial. Results indicated that mindfulness was negatively associated with level of nicotine dependence and withdrawal severity, and positively associated with a sense of agency regarding cessation. Moreover, mindfulness remained significantly associated with these measures even after controlling for key demographic variables. Results suggest that low level of mindfulness may be an important predictor of vulnerability to relapse among adult smokers preparing to quit; thus, mindfulness-based interventions may enhance cessation.},

Design Prospective, population based study with four years of follow up. Setting City of Leiden, the Netherlands. Participants 500 people aged 85 years at recruitment. Main outcome measures Annual assessments of depressive symptoms (15 item geriatric depression scale), global cognitive function (mini-mental state examination), attention (Stroop test), processing speed (letter digit coding test), and immediate and delayed recall (12 word learning test). Results At 85 years old, participants\&\#039; depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment were highly significantly correlated (P \&lt; 0.001). During follow up, an accelerated annual increase of depressive symptoms was associated with impaired attention (0.08 points (95\% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.16)), immediate recall (0.17 points (0.09 to 0.25)), and delayed recall (0.10 points (0.02 to 0.18)) at baseline. In contrast, depressive symptoms at baseline were not related to an accelerated cognitive decline during follow up (P \&gt; 0.05). Conclusion Caregivers should be aware of the development of depressive symptoms when cognitive impairment is present. However, the presence of depression only does not increase the risk of cognitive decline. Footnotes Contributors All authors participated in the planning, conduct, and reporting of the study.

Methods: In June 2020 an on-line questionnaire was administered to nurses in order to analyze any differences both in the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) and the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills (KIMS) according to gender variable. Findings: 200 questionnaires were collected. Findings showed significant higher MAAS total score in males than females (p=.004). Additionally, by considering the four sub dimensions in the Mindfulness tendency, females reported significant higher levels in some items of “Observe” (p=.004) and “Act with awareness” (p=.001) than males, while males reported significant higher scores in the “Accept without judgement” than females (p{$<$}.001). Conclusions: The present study was a pilot research on exploring gender differences in mindfulness in Italian nurses in order to hope that it will be only the beginning of empirical research on this topic and to better address future mindfulness training courses addressed to nurses by emphasizing certain aspects of mindfulness for females compared to males and vice versa."}

We were interested in determining whether adolescents who bully others enjoy a key evolutionary benefit: increased dating and mating (sexual) opportunities. This hypothesis was tested in two independent samples consisting of 334 adolescents and 144 university students. The data partly supported our prediction that bullying, but not victimization, would predict dating behavior. The data for sexual behavior more clearly supported our hypothesis that bullying behavior predicts an increase in sexual opportunities even when accounting for age, sex, and self-reports of attractiveness, likeability, and peer victimization. These results are generally congruent with the hypothesis that bullying perpetration is, at least in part, an evolutionary adaptive behavior.},

Female and male responders differed in the domains professional commitment, resistance to stress and emotional well-being. Female physicians on average scored higher in the dimensions resignation tendencies, satisfaction with life and experience of social support, and lower in career ambition.CONCLUSION:The results show distinct psychosocial stress patterns among medical students and physicians. Health promotion and prevention of psychosocial symptoms and impairments should be integrated as a required part of the medical curriculum and be considered an important issue during the further training of physicians.}

  abstract = {Much biomedical research is observational. The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalisability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September, 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles.18 items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies.A detailed explanation and elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the websites of PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, and Epidemiology. We hope that the STROBE statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies},

It can fail in multimodal distributions, or in distributions where one tail is long but the other is heavy. Most commonly, though, the rule fails in discrete distributions where the areas to the left and right of the median are not equal. Such distributions not only contradict the textbook relationship between mean, median, and skew, they also contradict the textbook interpretation of the median. We discuss ways to correct ideas about mean, median, and skew, while enhancing the desired intuition.},

  abstract = {Objective: Catastrophic thinking is associated with disability and distress for many with chronic pain. The effects of catastrophic thinking likely rely not only on the content or frequency of the thoughts, but also on other cognitive, behavioral, and environmental influences that are present. One possible influence is acceptance, which involves experiencing thoughts, moods, or sensations without some of their supplemental psychological effects on behavior, especially when these effects can contribute to less freedom in daily functioning. Design: The present study sought to explore how acceptance influenced the relations between catastrophizing and patient functioning in 344 individuals with chronic pain. Main Outcome Measures: Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire, Pain Catastrophizing Scale. Results: Analyses indicated that acceptance mediated the effects of catastrophic thinking on depression, anxiety and avoidance, and physical and psychosocial functioning with indirect effect tests suggesting that the variance in functioning predicted by catastrophizing was significantly reduced with the inclusion of acceptance. Conclusion: These results suggest that research and clinical work in the area may benefit from a broadened perspective where the occurrence of catastrophic thinking is considered within the wider context of the behavioral processes that give this thinking its impact.},

  abstract = {The paper aims at answering the question: Has the measurement of patient satisfaction improved the quality of care? After concluding that there is no evidence in the literature, the paper proceeds to look at why the evidence is lacking. Four factors seem to explain it: the objectives, the focus and the originator of the patients satisfaction studies and measurements and difficulties related to the interpretation of the findings. The last part of the paper analyses why patient satisfaction should be taken seriously although we do not know whether its measurement improves the quality of care. They include the fact that the patients are partners in health care; they literally feel in their skin whether care is good or bad. They are also the best judges of certain aspects of care, such as amenities and interpersonal relations. The second reason is the transformation of health care from a sellers market to a consumers' market where the satisfaction of the patients needs is part of the definition of quality. Finally, there is the ideological reason that, in a democratic society, the patients should have the right to influence decisions and activities influencing them. Measurement of patient satisfaction realizes the principle of community participation in health care.},

According to the fallacy, high-power experiments always yield more informative data than do low-power experiments. Here we expose the fallacy with concrete examples, demonstrating that a particular outcome from a high-power experiment can be completely uninformative, whereas a particular outcome from a low-power experiment can be highly informative. Although power is useful in planning an experiment, it is less useful-and sometimes even misleading-for making inferences from observed data. To make inferences from data, we recommend the use of likelihood ratios or Bayes factors, which are the extension of likelihood ratios beyond point hypotheses. These methods of inference do not average over hypothetical replications of an experiment, but instead condition on the data that have actually been observed. In this way, likelihood ratios and Bayes factors rationally quantify the evidence that a particular data set provides for or against the null or any other hypothesis.},

Despite this popularity, or perhaps because of it, most psychologists are not aware of the statistical peculiarities of thep value procedure. In particular,p values are based on data that were never observed, and these hypothetical data are themselves influenced by subjective intentions. Moreover,p values do not quantify statistical evidence. This article reviews thesep value problems and illustrates each problem with concrete examples. The three problems are familiar to statisticians but may be new to psychologists. A practical solution to thesep value problems is to adopt a model selection perspective and use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for statistical inference (Raftery, 1995). The BIC provides an approximation to a Bayesian hypothesis test, does not require the specification of priors, and can be easily calculated from SPSS output.},

  abstract = {This article provides a description of a clinical project that used combined Tai Chi and mindfulness-based stress reduction as an educational program. The 5-week program demonstrated that sustained interest in this material in middle school-aged boys and girls is possible. Statements the boys and girls made in the process suggested that they experienced well-being, calmness, relaxation, improved sleep, less reactivity, increased self-care, self-awareness, and a sense of interconnection or interdependence with nature. The curriculum is described in detail for nurses, teachers, and counselors who want to replicate this type of instruction for adolescent children. This project infers that Tai Chi and mindfulness-based stress reduction may be transformational tools that can be used in educational programs appropriate for middle school-aged children. Recommendations are made for further study in schools and other pediatric settings.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to apply a novel economic tool (cost satisfaction analysis) to assess the utility of fixed prosthodontics, to review its applicability, and to explore the perceived value of treatment. The cost satisfaction analysis employed the validated Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ). Patients with a known prostheses outcome over 1-20 years were mailed the PSQ. Five hundred patients (50˙7\%) responded. Remembered satisfaction at insertion (initial costs) and current satisfaction (costs in hindsight) were reported on VAS, and the difference calculated (costs with time). Percentage and grouped responses (low, {$<$}40\%; medium, 40-70\%; high, {$>$} 70\%) were analysed in relation to patient gender, age and willingness to have undergone the same treatment again, and in relation to prostheses age, type, complexity and outcome. Significance was set at P = 0˙05. Averages were reported as means ± standard error. Satisfaction with initial costs and costs in hindsight were unrelated to patient gender and age, and prostheses age, type and complexity. Patients with a failure and those who would elect to not undergo the same treatment again were significantly less satisfied with initial costs (P = 0˙021, P {$<$} 0˙001) and costs in hindsight (P = 0˙021, P {$<$} 0˙001) than their counterparts. Patient's cost satisfaction (entire cohort) had significantly improved from 53 ± 1\% at insertion to 81 ± 0˙9\% in hindsight (28 ± 1\% improvement, P {$<$} 0˙001). Patient cost satisfaction had also significantly improved, and the magnitude of improvement was the same within every individual cohort (P = 0˙004 to P {$<$} 0˙001), including patients with failures, and those who in hindsight would not undergo the same treatment again. Low satisfaction was reported by 166 patients initially, but 94\% of these reported improvements in hindsight. Fourteen patients (3\%) remained dissatisfied in hindsight, although 71\% of these would still choose to undergo the same treatment again. Cost satisfaction analysis provided an evaluation of the patient's perspective of the value of fixed prosthodontic treatment. Although fixed prosthodontic treatment was perceived by patients to be expensive, it was also perceived to impart value with time. Cost satisfaction analysis provides a clinically useful insight into patient behaviour.},

  abstract = {Aspects of the female body may be attractive because they signal evolutionary fitness. Greater body fatness might reflect greater potential to survive famines, but individuals carrying larger fat stores may have poor health and lower fertility in non-famine conditions. A mathematical statistical model using epidemiological data linking fatness to fitness traits, predicted a peaked relationship between fatness and attractiveness (maximum at body mass index (BMI) = 22.8 to 24.8 depending on ethnicity and assumptions). Participants from three Caucasian populations (Austria, Lithuania and the UK), three Asian populations (China, Iran and Mauritius) and four African populations (Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria and Senegal) rated attractiveness of a series of female images varying in fatness (BMI) and waist to hip ratio (WHR). There was an inverse linear relationship between physical attractiveness and body fatness or BMI in all populations. Lower body fat was more attractive, down to at least BMI = 19. There was no peak in the relationship over the range we studied in any population. WHR was a significant independent but less important factor, which was more important (greater r2) in African populations. Predictions based on the fitness model were not supported. Raters appeared to use body fat percentage (BF\%) and BMI as markers of age. The covariance of BF\% and BMI with age indicates that the role of body fatness alone, as a marker of attractiveness, has been overestimated.},

One profitable but overlooked solution may be for restaurants to focus on menu engineering strategies that could increase sales of relatively healthier, high margin appetizers and entrées and help diners become slim by design. Recent lab and field research in consumer psychology and behavioral economics offer promising solutions that responsible restaurants can use to profitably guide their customers to healthier decisions by using the three-step menu engineering process of (1) shifting attention, (2) enhancing taste expectations, and (3) increasing perception of value. A review of these studies provides key implications that can both increase the healthfulness of what customers order along with the profits of the restaurant.},

Insight in its factor structure and dimensionality could help to develop more homogeneous IDS-SR subscales. However previous factoranalytical studies have found mixed results. Therefore, the present study tested which factor structure underlies the IDS-SR and, in addition, if the factors can be used as unidimensional subscales.Methods{$<$}br/{$>$}Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was done to identify the best-fitting factor structure. The study sample consisted of 2600 individuals (mean age 40.5 ± 12.1). We assessed model fit in 4 groups: 957 Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) patients, 450 remitted MDD patients, 570 patients with an anxiety disorder and 623 healthy controls to test the consistency of model fit. Rasch analyses in the full sample were used to evaluate and optimize the unidimensionality and psychometric quality of the factors.Results{$<$}br/{$>$}CFA indicated that a 3-factor model fits the IDS-SR data best and is consistent across groups, with a [`]mood/cognition' factor, an [`]anxiety/arousal' factor and a [`]sleep' factor. In addition, Rasch analyses indicated that the [`]mood/cognition' and [`]anxiety/arousal' factors could be optimized to be used as unidimensional subscales.Limitations{$<$}br/{$>$}The fit of only 4 models was tested, ranging from a 1- to 4-factor model.Conclusions{$<$}br/{$>$}The IDS-SR is a heterogeneous instrument with a multifactorial underlying structure.

The Godspeed Questionnaire Series (GQS) is one of the most frequently used questionnaires in the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) with over 160 citations as of October 2014. In this paper, we present a meta analysis of studies that used the GQS. The HRI community uses a large variety of robotic platforms and only the NAO robot seems to be used by multiple research groups. A qualitative meta analysis of 18 NAO studies reveals accumulated findings on perceived intelligence, likability, and anthropomorphism, but also reveals contradictions on how the robot's behaviour and task context impact GQS ratings. The paper closes with a reflection on how added value of data analysis and presentation could be achieved for the HRI community in future.},

  abstract = {Background and objective: There are no nursing centric data in the hospital discharge abstract. This study investigates whether adding nursing data in the form of nursing diagnoses to medical diagnostic data in the discharge abstract can improve overall explanation of variance in commonly studied hospital outcomes. Method: A retrospective analyses of 123,241 sequential patient admissions to a university hospital in a Midwestern city was performed. Two data sets were combined: (1) a daily collection of patient assessments by nurses using nursing diagnosis terminology (NDX); and (2) the summary discharge information from the hospital discharge abstract including diagnosis-related group (DRG) and all payer refined DRG (APR-DRG). Each of 61 daily NDX observations were collapsed as frequency of occurrence for the hospital stay and inserted into the discharge abstract. NDX was then compared to both DRG and APR-DRG across 5 hospital outcome variables using multivariate regression or logistic regression. Results and conclusions: In all statistical models, DRG, APR-DRG, and NDX were significantly associated with the 5 hospital outcome variables (P {$<$}.0001). When NDX was added to models containing either the DRG or the APR-DRG, explanatory power (R2) and model discrimination (c statistic) improved by 30\% to 146\% across the outcome variables of hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, total charges, probably of death, and discharge to a nursing home (P {$<$}.0001). The findings support the contention that nursing care is an independent predictor of patient hospital outcomes. These nursing data are not redundant with the medical diagnosis, in particular, the DRG. The findings support the argument for including nursing care data in the hospital discharge abstract. Further study is needed to clarify which nursing data are the best fit for the current hospital discharge abstract data collection scheme. (C) 2005 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

AND STUDY PARTICIPANTS: The questionnaire was administered to 263 South African black diabetic outpatients from the diabetic clinics at two hospitals. There were 174 females and 89 males, aged between 16 and 89 years (mean = 53.5, sd = 13.9). The average number of years of schooling was 6.3 (sd = 4.1). Main outcome measure. A reliable and valid patient satisfaction scale.: Factor analysis was conducted on the patient satisfaction scale and two factors, accounting for 71.6\% of the variance, were extracted. The major items on Factor I were support, consideration, friendliness, and encouragement, labelled the interpersonal dimension. Factor II emphasized availability of a seat and toilet in the waiting area and cleanliness, labelled the organizational dimension. The two factors had very good reliability coefficients: 0.85 (organizational) and 0.98 (interpersonal). Multi-trait scaling showed that all items exceeded the item convergent (r {$>$} 0.40) and discriminant (Z {$>$} 1.96) validity criteria. Patients in poor general health were significantly less satisfied (P = 0.007) with the organizational quality of their care than patients in good health; patients in poor mental health were significantly less satisfied (P = 0.04) with the interpersonal quality of their care than patients in good mental health.: The findings provided support for Donabedian's model. They demonstrated that attributes of providers and settings are major components of patient satisfaction, and showed that the scale is a reliable and valid measure of patient satisfaction for this South African population.},

  abstract = {Social scientists often seek to demonstrate that a construct has incremental validity over and above other related constructs. However, these claims are typically supported by measurement-level models that fail to consider the effects of measurement (un)reliability. We use intuitive examples, Monte Carlo simulations, and a novel analytical framework to demonstrate that common strategies for establishing incremental construct validity using multiple regression analysis exhibit extremely high Type I error rates under parameter regimes common in many psychological domains. Counterintuitively, we find that error rates are highest—in some cases approaching 100\%—when sample sizes are large and reliability is moderate. Our findings suggest that a potentially large proportion of incremental validity claims made in the literature are spurious. We present a web application (http://jakewestfall.org/ivy/) that readers can use to explore the statistical properties of these and other incremental validity arguments. We conclude by reviewing SEM-based statistical approaches that appropriately control the Type I error rate when attempting to establish incremental validity.},

  abstract = {Although sample size calculations have become an important element in the design of research projects, such methods for studies involving current status data are scarce. Here, we propose a method for calculating power and sample size for studies using current status data. This method is based on a Weibull survival model for a two-group comparison. The Weibull model allows the investigator to specify a group difference in terms of a hazards ratio or a failure time ratio. We consider exponential, Weibull and uniformly distributed censoring distributions. We base our power calculations on a parametric approach with the Wald test because it is easy for medical investigators to conceptualize and specify the required input variables. As expected, studies with current status data have substantially less power than studies with the usual right-censored failure time data. Our simulation results demonstrate the merits of these proposed power calculations.},

  abstract = {Mindfulness-based training programs are highly established in competitive and recreational sports. One of the best-known approaches is the Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment Approach (MAC) by Gardner and Moore), which integrates mindfulness aspects of awareness, non-judgmental attitude, and focus. Based on these aspects, Thienot and colleagues developed and validated an English language sport-specific questionnaire, the so-called Mindfulness Inventory for Sport (MIS), for the assessment of mindfulness skills in athletes. The aim of this study is to psychometrically test a German language version of the MIS (MIS-D). To assess the psychometric properties, the MIS-D was examined in an online survey with an integrated test–retest design (               n               \,=\,228) for reliability (internal consistency; test–retest reliability), validity (factorial; convergent), and measurement invariance (gender; competition type). The present results support the psychometric quality of the German language version of the MIS. Necessary replications should among others focus on checking the measurement invariance for further relevant subgroups.}

  abstract = {Several investigators have observed that irregular breathing occurs during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep in healthy subjects, with ventilatory suppression being prominent during active eye movements [phasic REM (PREM) sleep] as opposed to tonic REM (TREM) sleep, when ocular activity is absent and ventilation more regular. Inasmuch as considerable data suggest that rapid eye movements are a manifestation of sleep-induced neural events that may importantly influence respiratory neurons, we hypothesized that upper airway dilator muscle activation may also be suppressed during periods of active eye movements in REM sleep. We studied six normal men during single nocturnal sleep studies. Standard sleep-staging parameters, ventilation, and genioglossus and alae nasi electromyograms (EMG) were continuously recorded during the study. There were no significant differences in minute ventilation, tidal volume, or any index of genioglossus or alae nasi EMG amplitude between non-REM (NREM) and REM sleep, when REM was analyzed as a single sleep stage. Each breath during REM sleep was scored as "phasic" or "tonic," depending on its proximity to REM deflections on the electrooculogram. Comparison of all three sleep states (NREM, PREM, and TREM) revealed that peak inspiratory genioglossus and alae nasi EMG activities were significantly decreased during PREM sleep compared with TREM sleep [genioglossus (arbitrary units): NREM 49 +/- 12 (mean +/- SE), TREM 49 +/- 5, PREM 20 +/- 5 (P less than 0.05, PREM different from TREM and NREM); alae nasi: NREM 16 +/- 4, TREM 38 +/- 7, PREM 10 +/- 4 (P less than 0.05, PREM different from TREM)]. We also observed, as have others, that ventilation, tidal volume, and mean inspiratory airflow were significantly decreased and respiratory frequency was increased during PREM sleep compared with both TREM and NREM sleep. We conclude that hypoventilation occurs in concert with reduced upper airway dilator muscle activation during PREM sleep by mechanisms that remain to be established.},

This shift is away from manual control and toward activities that tap the higher mental functioning of human operators. Therefore, an experiment was performed in a moving-base flight simulator to assess mediational (cognitive) workload measurement. Specifically, 16 workload estimation techniques were evaluated as to their sensitivity and intrusion in a flight task emphasizing mediational behavior. Task loading, using navigation problems presented on a display, was treated as an independent variable, and workload-measure values were treated as dependent variables. Results indicate that two mediational task measures, two rating scale measures, time estimation, and two eye behavior measures were reliably sensitive to mediational loading. The time estimation measure did, however, intrude on mediational task performance. Several of the remaining measures were completely insensitive to mediational load.},

We conducted a cross-sectional as well as a two-week-diary study with 35 dual-earner couples (N = 70 working adults, 51.3 \% married). Besides work-family conflict, we measured variables such as subjective involvement in the work and family domains, emotional well-being, and personal goals. Work-family conflicts were partly interdependent between the two partners: everyday conflicts due to negative influences of the partnership domain were positively interrelated. Work-family conflict were mainly predicted by psychological variables (e. g., subjective involvement in the professional domain), whereas sociodemographic parameters (e. g., gender) were of minor importance. Cross-sectionally as well as processually work-family conflicts were related to negative emotions. Positive emotions were mainly influenced by individual goal progress and by perceiving the partner as content and supportive.

  abstract = {PURPOSE To examine the completeness and validity of the terms used in ENP in describing nursing diagnoses using a cross-mapping to ICNP. METHODS The mapping procedure was carried out using the parallel mapping method. RESULTS The interrater reliability showed good to very good results. The percentage of agreement of the rating results for the ICNP phenomenon axes was between 73\% and 99\%, and the randomly adjusted Cohen's Kappa value was 0.88 on the ICNP focus axis. DISCUSSION The results of the mapping show that both classifications, ENP and INCP, are not yet complete for illustrating all aspects of nursing. Both classifications use a large proportion of overlapping terms (75\%), and a small proportion of terms (25\%) which describe different dimensions of nursing in both ENP and ICNP. CONCLUSION The results of the mapping are discussed in consideration of the nurse's perspective. The main focus is on the difference between pre-combined systems, like ENP, and post-combined, like ICNP, and their implications on the use of nursing classifications in practice for the illustration of the nursing process.},

Nurses and nursing support staff increasingly require computers to carry out their work. Minimum computer competencies for nurses have been identified. The determination of whether the current nursing workforce has acquired these competencies remains uncertain. We administered a self-assessment survey to nurses and nursing support staff to determine proficiency with computer skills they might perform at work. Respondents reported inadequacies in basic and work-related computer skills. More than 28\% scored themselves as having fair or poor proficiency on all skills, and more than 50\% as fair or poor on five of 11 skills. Respondents over age 50 and those graduating before 1984 tended to score proficiency lower. Our study suggests that many nurses and nursing support staff may not have the minimum computer competencies to effectively and efficiently perform their work.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study examines differences in computer-related self-efficacy and anxiety in subgroups of older adults, and changes in those measures after exposure to a systematic training program and subsequent computer use. METHODS: Participants were volunteers in the Intelligent Systems for Assessment of Aging Changes study (ISAAC) carried out by the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology. Participants were administered two questionnaires before training and again 1 year later, which were related to computer self-efficacy and anxiety. Continuous recording of computer use was also assessed for a subset of participants. RESULTS: Baseline comparisons by sex, age, education, living arrangement, and computer proficiency, but not cognitive status, yielded significant differences in confidence and anxiety related to specific aspects of computer use. At 1-year follow-up, participants reported less anxiety and greater confidence. However, the benefits of training and exposure varied by group and task. Comparisons based on cognitive status showed that the cognitively intact participants benefited more from training and/or experience with computers than did participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), who after 1 year continued to report less confidence and more anxiety regarding certain aspects of computer use. CONCLUSION: After 1 year of consistent computer use, cognitively intact participants in this study reported reduced levels of anxiety and increased self-confidence in their ability to perform specific computer tasks. Participants with MCI at baseline were less likely to demonstrate increased efficacy or confidence than their cognitively intact counterparts.},

We begin with an exploration of different perspectives of empathy; from its behavioural and measurable characteristics to its less tangible, intuitive qualities. By drawing upon both policy and research, it is clear that patients want empathic and emotionally competent nurses. Nurse educators therefore have a responsibility to provide an education that engenders empathic understanding. We explore the implications of these findings for nurse education, identifying key areas for consideration in the preparation of emotionally skilled, empathic student nurses.},

In phase II, the questionnaire was tested for validity and reliability in a group of patients recently discharged from two ``hospital-at-home��? intermediate-care schemes. In phase III, a shortened version of the questionnaire was psychometrically tested in five sites taking part in a national evaluation of intermediate care.Results: 96 patients with an average age of 76.5 years took part in phase II. Test--retest reliability was evaluated by repeating the questionnaire 2 weeks later in a subsample of 42 patients. This was ``moderate��? (\$κ\$ 0.4--0.6) for 12 questions, ``fair��? (\$κ\$ 0.2--0.4) for 6 questions and ``poor��? (\$κ\$ 0.1--0.2) for 5 questions. Scores correlated well with the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (Spearman's r{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.75, p{$<$}0.001). 843 patients (57\% of those eligible) from five intermediate-care schemes took part in phase III. Principal components analysis suggested six factors or subscales: general satisfaction, affective response, cognitive response, timing of discharge, coordination after discharge, and access to pain relief, although the last three factors comprised only one question each. The intraclass correlation coefficients in the first three subscales varied from 0.82 to 0.89. Scores for all subscales differed by scheme, suggesting construct validity. Only one question (on general satisfaction) was found to be redundant.Conclusion: The questionnaire, with some minor amendments to improve performance, could be used as a validated tool for audit and research in intermediate care. An amended version and scoring programme is available from us on request.}

By fitting models to experimental data we can probe the algorithms underlying behavior, find neural correlates of computational variables and better understand the effects of drugs, illness and interventions. But with great power comes great responsibility. Here, we offer ten simple rules to ensure that computational modeling is used with care and yields meaningful insights. In particular, we present a beginner-friendly, pragmatic and details-oriented introduction on how to relate models to data. What, exactly, can a model tell us about the mind? To answer this, we apply our rules to the simplest modeling techniques most accessible to beginning modelers and illustrate them with examples and code available online. However, most rules apply to more advanced techniques. Our hope is that by following our guidelines, researchers will avoid many pitfalls and unleash the power of computational modeling on their own data.},

  abstract = {Leistungssportlern werden oft Eigenschaften zugeschrieben, die auch für das Berufsleben vorteilhaft sind. Sie seien besonders leistungsmotiviert, frustrationstolerant und ehrgeizig. Diese Eigenschaften führen dazu, dass sie sich in Aufgaben „festbeißen“ können und diese auch gegen Widerstände ausdauernd bearbeiten. Im Extremfall kann ein solches Verhalten suchtartige Ausmaße annehmen – es wird dann von Arbeitssucht gesprochen. Arbeitssucht kann zu psychischer und physischer Erschöpfung sowie zu gesundheitlichen Beschwerden führen. Lennighaus (2017) zeigte, dass aktive Spitzenfußballer eine höhere Tendenz zur Arbeitssucht besitzen als Topmanager. Wir untersuchten, ob ehemalige Eliteathleten auch nach ihrer Spitzensportkarriere anfällig für arbeitssüchtiges Verhalten sind. Dazu wurden in einer Online-Studie 30 ehemalige A-, B- und C-Kaderathleten olympischer Individualsportarten (16 Männer, 14 Frauen, Altersdurchschnitt = 31,4) mittels der Skala zur Erfassung von Arbeitssucht (Schneider \& Bühler, 2014) befragt. Ergänzend wurden gesundheitliche Beschwerden und Stressbewältigungsstrategien erfasst. Als Vergleichsgruppe dienten 34 Personen ohne leistungssportlichen Hintergrund (23 Männer, 9 Frauen, 2 o.A., Altersdurchschnitt = 33,0) Die Ergebnisse der Untersuchung zeigen, dass ehemalige Eliteathleten gegenüber Nicht-Eliteathleten hinsichtlich des Auftretens von Arbeitssucht keine signifikanten Unterschiede aufweisen (t(47.94)=-.88, p=.19, 1-seitig). Die Mittelwerte für die Arbeitssucht liegen bei beiden Gruppen im mittleren Normbereich. Auch für die gesundheitlichen Beschwerden (t(62)=1.01, p=.32, 2-seitig) und die Stressbewältigungsstrategien (Aktives Coping t(62)=-.20, p=.84; Soziale Unterstützung t(62)=1.26, p=.21; Alkohol- und Zigarettenkonsum t(62)=-.82, p=.41, alle 2-seitig) wurden keine Unterschiede zwischen den Gruppen festgestellt. Eine Sportkader-Biographie erhöht daher nicht die Wahrscheinlichkeit für eine Arbeitssucht nach Beendigung der sportlichen Karriere.}

  abstract = {Hallucinogenic psilocybin is known to alter the subjective experience of time. However, there is no study that systematically investigated objective measures of time perception under psilocybin. Therefore, we studied dose-dependent effects of the serotonin (5-HT)2A/1A receptor agonist psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine) on temporal processing, employing tasks of temporal reproduction, sensorimotor synchronization and tapping tempo. To control for cognitive and subjective changes, we assessed spatial working memory and conscious experience. Twelve healthy human volunteers were tested under placebo, medium (115 microg/kg), and high (250 microg/kg) dose conditions, in a double-blind experimental design. Psilocybin was found to significantly impair subjects' ability to (1) reproduce interval durations longer than 2.5 sec, (2) to synchronize to inter-beat intervals longer than 2 sec and (3) caused subjects to be slower in their preferred tapping rate. These objective effects on timing performance were accompanied by working-memory deficits and subjective changes in conscious state, namely increased reports of 'depersonalization' and 'derealization' phenomena including disturbances in subjective 'time sense.' Our study is the first to systematically assess the impact of psilocybin on timing performance on standardized measures of temporal processing. Results indicate that the serotonin system is selectively involved in duration processing of intervals longer than 2 to 3 seconds and in the voluntary control of the speed of movement. We speculate that psilocybin's selective disruption of longer intervals is likely to be a product of interactions with cognitive dimensions of temporal processing -presumably via 5-HT2A receptor stimulation.},

  abstract = {An object moving towards an observer is subjectively perceived as longer in duration than the same object that is static or moving away. This "time dilation effect" has been shown for a number of stimuli that differ from standard events along different feature dimensions (e.g. color, size, and dynamics). We performed an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, while subjects viewed a stream of five visual events, all of which were static and of identical duration except the fourth one, which was a deviant target consisting of either a looming or a receding disc. The duration of the target was systematically varied and participants judged whether the target was shorter or longer than all other events. A time dilation effect was observed only for looming targets. Relative to the static standards, the looming as well as the receding targets induced increased activation of the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortices (the "core control network"). The decisive contrast between looming and receding targets representing the time dilation effect showed strong asymmetric activation and, specifically, activation of cortical midline structures (the "default network"). These results provide the first evidence that the illusion of temporal dilation is due to activation of areas that are important for cognitive control and subjective awareness. The involvement of midline structures in the temporal dilation illusion is interpreted as evidence that time perception is related to self-referential processing.},

  abstract = {It has been suggested that perception and action can be understood as evolving in temporal epochs or sequential processing units. Successive events are fused into units forming a unitary experience or ?psychological present?. Studies have identified several temporal integration levels on different time scales which are fundamental for our understanding of behaviour and subjective experience. In recent literature concerning the philosophy and neuroscience of consciousness these separate temporal processing levels are not always precisely distinguished. Therefore, empirical evidence from psychophysics and neuropsychology on these distinct temporal processing levels is presented and discussed within philosophical conceptualizations of time experience. On an elementary level, one can identify a functional moment, a basic temporal building block of perception in the range of milliseconds that defines simultaneity and succession. Below a certain threshold temporal order is not perceived, individual events are processed as co-temporal. On a second level, an experienced moment, which is based on temporal integration of up to a few seconds, has been reported in many qualitatively different experiments in perception and action. It has been suggested that this segmental processing mechanism creates temporal windows that provide a logistical basis for conscious representation and the experience of nowness. On a third level of integration, continuity of experience is enabled by working-memory in the range of multiple seconds allowing the maintenance of cognitive operations and emotional feelings, leading to mental presence, a temporal window of an individual?s experienced presence.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a short, 4-item arthritis severity questionnaire that is simple to score, clinically useful and meaningful, and suitable for use in primary care, where osteoarthritis (OA) is the primary prevalent arthritis illness. METHODS: Data and items from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36), the Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC(c)), and visual analog scales (VAS) for pain and patient global severity were studied in 16,519 patients with arthritis. The Short Arthritis Assessment Scale (SAS) was developed by performing multivariable analyses that involved individually adding/subtracting items in differing regression models. The candidate items and scales were then studied by Rasch analysis, and tested for effect size, sensitivity to change, and reliability. The resultant scale was validated using data from a recent OA clinical trial. RESULTS: The VAS pain and VAS global severity scales and 2 items from the WOMAC in the VAS format, difficulty going down stairs and difficulty shopping, were found to be the best predictors of change in health status. The 4-item SAS was reliable (Cronbach's alpha = 0.87), demonstrated good test-retest reliability (Lin's concordance coefficient = 0.85), was unidimensional, and was strongly correlated with other important clinical measures, indicating good construct validity. Using data from a recent randomized clinical trial in OA, the SAS performed better than the WOMAC pain scale and the SF-36 physical component score in detecting change, and at least as well as the clinical trial VAS pain scale. CONCLUSION: The SAS is a 4-item arthritis severity questionnaire that can be easily administered in primary care for patients with OA, but is suitable for use across all arthritis illnesses. Scoring is simple, requiring only the addition of four 10-point scales, and interpretation is straightforward. The SAS may have a role in rapid assessment of the arthritis patient in primary care practice.}

Although these cross-sectional studies are informative, cause and effect are impossible to establish without longitudinal investigation of the same individuals before and after an intervention. Several longitudinal studies have been conducted (e.g., [9-18]); some involved children or young adults, potentially conflating brain development with learning, most were restricted to the motor domain, and all concerned relatively short timescales (weeks or months). Here, by contrast, we utilized a unique opportunity to study average-IQ adults operating in the real world as they learned, over four years, the complex layout of London's streets while training to become licensed taxi drivers. In those who qualified, acquisition of an internal spatial representation of London was associated with a selective increase in gray matter (GM) volume in their posterior hippocampi and concomitant changes to their memory profile. No structural brain changes were observed in trainees who failed to qualify or control participants. We conclude that specific, enduring, structural brain changes in adult humans can be induced by biologically relevant behaviors engaging higher cognitive functions such as spatial memory, with significance for the "nature versus nurture" debate. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In the scarce condition, the cookies were either constantly scarce or they began in abundant supply and then decreased. Ss were told that this decrease in supply was either due to an accident or to a high demand for the cookies. In the abundant condition, the cookies were either constantly abundant or first scarce and then abundant. The increase in supply was either due to an accident or to a lack of demand for the cookies. These conditions were crossed with a manipulation in which Ss thought either a high or low number of additional Ss were still to participate in the study. Results indicate that (a) cookies in scarce supply were rated as more desirable than cookies in abundant supply; (b) cookies were rated as more valuable when their supply changed from abundant to scarce than when they were constantly scarce; and (c) cookies scarce because of high demand were rated higher than cookies that were scarce because of an accident. With regard to abundance, cookies that were constantly abundant were rated higher than cookies that began scarce but later became abundant. Results extend commodity theory. Reactance was hypothesized as an intervening process responsible for some of the results. The 2nd study was performed to rule out the possibility that demand characteristics were responsible for the obtained results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved)}

  abstract = {This article illustrates how Rasch measurement (G. Rasch, 1961) is preferable to factor analysis for reducing complex data matrices to unidimensional variables. The two methods: (1) address the same kind of data, but with different interpretations of numerical status; (2) use the same estimation methods, but with different measurement models; and (3) solve the same problems, but with substantially different utility. Factor analysis is faulted for mistaking ordinally labeled stochastic observations for linear measures and for failing to construct linear measurement. The motivation and mathematical basis for Rasch measurement are introduced. How to use Rasch measurement to replace factor analysis is developed for a dichotomy and demonstrated for a rating scale.

The focus is on null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), choosing a statistical test, and what should be included in results sections. RESULTS: There are several ways to improve how statistics are reported. These should improve both the authors' and the readers' understanding of the data. CONCLUSIONS: Psychology as a discipline will improve if the way in which statistics are conducted and reported is improved. This will require effort from authors, scrutiny from reviewers, and stubbornness from editors.},

  abstract = {AIM: The diagnostic performance of Fibroscan might be improved when combined with other serum fibrosis related markers. Previous study has demonstrated that S100A4 expression is associated with liver fibrosis in humans with hepatitis. This study aimed to clarify diagnostic accuracy of serum S100A4 levels for significant liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and develop a combined algorithm of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and S100A4 to predict significant liver fibrosis in CHB. METHODS: One hundred and seventy-five CHB patients who had performed liver biopsy were consecutively included. We evaluated serum S100A4 levels, LSM values and other clinically-approved fibrosis scores. RESULTS: Serum S100A4 level was higher in CHB patients with significant fibrosis, compared to those without [199.58 (33.31-1971.96) vs. 107.15 (2.10-1038.94), P{$<$}0.001]. Using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, the area under the curves (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of S100A4 were found to be 0.749, 62.7\%, 75.9\% and 0.70 for significant fibrosis (≥Stage 2), respectively. Although not superior to LSM, these results were better than the fibrosis index based on the 4 factor (FIB-4) and the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) for significant fibrosis detection. An algorithm consisting of S100A4 and LSM was derived. The AUC, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of model based on serum S100A4 level and LSM were 0.866, 86.6\%, 77.8\% and 0.79 for significant fibrosis detection, superior to those based on LSM alone (0.834, 76.1\%, 80.7\% and 0.76, P=0.041). CONCLUSION: Serum S100A4 level was identified as a fibrosis marker of liver fibrosis in patients with CHB. Combining serum S100A4 with LSM improved the accuracy of transient elastography for hepatitis B significant fibrosis detection.},

I focus on several areas where the application of informatics approaches has already paid large dividends, leading to advances including novel data- collection approaches, the adaptation of computational techniques and insights, the enhanced aggregation and organization of psychological data, large-scale data mining and synthesis, and improved research and publication practices. I argue that in the coming years, informatics approaches are likely to play the same instrumental role in shaping psychological research that they have already played in other fields, such as genetics and neuroscience},

  abstract = {Most theories and hypotheses in psychology are verbal in nature, yet their evaluation overwhelmingly relies on inferential statistical procedures. The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned—that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here I argue that most inferential statistical tests in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. I demonstrate how foundational assumptions of the "random effects" model used pervasively in psychology impose far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints dramatically inflates false positive rates and routinely leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack any meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that the routine failure to consider the generalizability of one's conclusions from a statistical perspective lies at the root of many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.}

We analyzed the expression profiles of HCC samples without or with intra-hepatic metastases. Using a supervised machine-learning algorithm, we generated for the first time a molecular signature that can classify metastatic HCC patients and identified genes that were relevant to metastasis and patient survival. We found that the gene expression signature of primary HCCs with accompanying metastasis was very similar to that of their corresponding metastases, implying that genes favoring metastasis progression were initiated in the primary tumors. Osteopontin, which was identified as a lead gene in the signature, was over-expressed in metastatic HCC; an osteopontin-specific antibody effectively blocked HCC cell invasion in vitro and inhibited pulmonary metastasis of HCC cells in nude mice. Thus, osteopontin acts as both a diagnostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for metastatic HCC.},

  abstract = {Families often draw their conclusions about the quality of care received by a family member during the last months of life from their interactions with professional caregivers. A more comprehensive understanding of how these relationships influence the care experience should include an investigation of the association between employee job satisfaction and family perception of the quality of care. This cross-sectional study investigated the association at a regional hospice. Using the Kendall's tau correlation, employee satisfaction scores for care teams trended toward a positive correlation with family overall satisfaction scores from the Family Evaluation of Hospice Care (tau=0.47, P=0.10). A trend for differences in employee satisfaction between the care teams to associate with differences in overall family perceptions of the quality of care also was found using the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (chi(2)(K-W)=9.236, P=0.075). Post hoc tests indicated that overall family perceptions of quality of care differed between the hospice's Residence Team and Non-Hospice Facilities Team. Finally, positive associations between employee satisfaction and the families' Intent to recommend hospice (tau=0.55, P=0.059) and Inform and communicate about patient (tau=0.55, P=0.059) were noted. Selected employee and family comments provide complementarity to further clarify or explain the respondent data. These results suggest that employee satisfaction is associated with family perceptions of the quality of hospice care. Opportunities for improving both employee job satisfaction and family perceptions of the quality of care are discussed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the evidence of the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in improving stress, depression and anxiety in breast cancer patients. METHODS: An extensive systematic electronic review (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsyArticles, PsycINFO, Scopus, Ovid, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library) and a hand search were carried out from 15 October 2011 to 30 November 2011 to retrieve relevant articles using 'mindfulness' or 'mindfulness-based stress reduction' and 'breast cancer' as keywords. Information about the baseline characteristics of the participants, interventions and findings on perceived stress, depression and anxiety was extracted from each study. RESULTS: Nine published studies (two randomised controlled trials, one quasi-experimental case-control study and six one-group, pre-intervention and post-intervention studies) up to November 2011 that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were analysed. The pooled effect size (95\% CI) for MBSR on stress was 0.710 (0.511-0.909), on depression was 0.575 (0.429-0.722) and on anxiety was 0.733 (0.450-1.017). CONCLUSION: On the basis of these findings, MBSR shows a moderate to large positive effect size on the mental health of breast cancer patients and warrants further systematic investigation because it has a potential to make a significant improvement on mental health for women in this group.},

  abstract = {In this work, we address an important but unexplored topic, namely the neural correlates of hate. In a block-design fMRI study, we scanned 17 normal human subjects while they viewed the face of a person they hated and also faces of acquaintances for whom they had neutral feelings. A hate score was obtained for the object of hate for each subject and this was used as a covariate in a between-subject random effects analysis. Viewing a hated face resulted in increased activity in the medial frontal gyrus, right putamen, bilaterally in premotor cortex, in the frontal pole and bilaterally in the medial insula. We also found three areas where activation correlated linearly with the declared level of hatred, the right insula, right premotor cortex and the right fronto-medial gyrus. One area of deactivation was found in the right superior frontal gyrus. The study thus shows that there is a unique pattern of activity in the brain in the context of hate. Though distinct from the pattern of activity that correlates with romantic love, this pattern nevertheless shares two areas with the latter, namely the putamen and the insula.},

We validated our proteomics-discovered multianalyte profile (MAP) in CSF from 95 control subjects, 48 patients with probable AD, and 40 patients with probable PD. An optimal 8-member MAP agreed with expert diagnosis for 90 control subjects (95\%), 36 patients with probable AD (75\%), and 38 patients with probable PD (95\%). This MAP consisted of the following (in decreasing order of contribution): tau, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, interleukin 8, Abeta42, beta2-microglobulin, vitamin D binding protein, apolipoprotein (apo) AII, and apoE. This first large-scale validation of a proteomic-discovered MAP suggests a panel of 8 CSF proteins that are highly effective at identifying PD and moderately effective at identifying AD.},

In this Editorial the authors wanted to raise awareness concerning some of the problems the authors believe to have been identified regarding convergent and discriminant validation efforts. Summarizing the thoughts outlined above, the authors stress three aspects that papers reporting validation studies should follow: (1) The trait to be measured should be clearly defined and embedded within a nomological network. (2) Besides convergent validity, discriminant validity is important in order to gain a more complete picture of the validity of an instrument. To this end, different traits have to be assessed with different methods. The nomological network should guide the selection of the discriminant trait(s). (3) Effects of method variance should be modeled. This Editorial also suggests the need for more research in the areas of method variance producing, phenomena effects of item context, and the facet structure underlying and defining broad domains.

  abstract = {Over the last 12 months the author has had the pleasure to read some extraordinarily good papers that were submitted to the European Journal of Psychological Assessment. Oftentimes, his overly positive impression was mirrored by the reviews obtained for these papers. However, sometimes the submissions are not only impressive and sound; sometimes the potential of a paper is visible but buried beneath methodological and analytical problems. From time to time the author would like to use the editorial pages and provide an overview of issues often raised by reviewers and used as reasons to criticize or even reject a submission. His goal is to address some reoccurring issues in the hopes of eliminating them in the future and thereby improving the journal's overall quality. In this Editorial the author focuses specifically on the process of item selection.}

  abstract = {Neuroimaging in pathological gambling (PG) allows studying brain structure independent of pharmacological/neurotoxic effects occurring in substance addiction. Because of high comorbidity of PG with substance use disorder (SUD), first results on structural deficits in PG are controversial. The current investigation is the first to examine gray matter (GM) volume alterations in PG controlling for the impact of SUD by comparing non-comorbid (PGPURE ) and two comorbid (PGALCOHOL and PGPOLY ) groups. Two hundred and five individuals were included in the analysis: 107 patients diagnosed with PG and 98 healthy controls (HCs). We employed voxel-based morphometry to look for GM volume differences between the groups controlling for age, smoking and depression. GM decreases in the superior medial and orbital frontal cortex occur independently of substance use in PGPURE compared with HCs. The frontal pattern of GM decrease was comparable with PGALCOHOL group where additionally GM volume was decreased in the anterior cingulate but increased in the amygdala. Moreover, regions in PGALCOHOL + POLY with reduced GM volume were the medial frontal, anterior cingulate and occipital lobe regions. PGALCOHOL + POLY not only exhibited structural deficits in comparison with HCs but also relative to PGPURE in the precuneus and post-central gyrus. We demonstrated specific frontal cortex GM deficits in PG without SUD comorbidities. Whereas some target regions reported in earlier studies might result from comorbid substance abuse, there seems to be a core set of frontal alterations associated with addicted gambling behaviour independent of toxic substance effects.},

Partially consistent with prediction, results indicated that, relative to negative and positive affectivity and emotional expression and processing associated with approach-oriented coping, mindfulness-based attention incrementally predicted anhedonic depressive, but not anxious arousal, symptoms. Additionally, consistent with prediction, mindfulness-based attention demonstrated incremental validity in relation to perceived health, and the degree of impairment of health in terms of physical and mental functioning. Results are discussed in relation to the construct development of mindfulness-based attention, and specifically, the role(s) of this factor in emotional and physical health processes.},

  abstract = {This review examined articles on mobile apps for science learning published from 2007 to 2014. A qualitative content analysis was used to investigate the science mobile app research for its mobile app design, underlying theoretical foundations, and students' measured outcomes. This review found that mobile apps for science learning offered a number of similar design features, including technology-based scaffolding, location-aware functionality, visual/audio representations, digital knowledge-construction tools, digital knowledge-sharing mechanisms, and differentiated roles. Many of the studies cited a specific theoretical foundation, predominantly situated learning theory, and applied this to the design of the mobile learning environment. The most common measured outcome was students' basic scientific knowledge or conceptual understanding. A number of recommendations came out of this review. Future studies need to make use of newer, available technologies; isolate the testing of specific app features; and develop additional strategies around using mobile apps for collaboration. Researchers need to make more explicit connections between the instructional principles and the design features of their mobile learning environment in order to better integrate theory with practice. In addition, this review noted that stronger alignment is needed between the underlying theories and measured outcomes, and more studies are needed to assess students' higher-level cognitive outcomes, cognitive load, and skill-based outcomes such as problem solving. Finally, more research is needed on how science mobile apps can be used with more varied science topics and diverse audiences.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: ADHD is a childhood-onset psychiatric condition that often continues into adulthood. Stimulant medications are the mainstay of treatment; however, additional approaches are frequently desired. In recent years, mindfulness meditation has been proposed to improve attention, reduce stress, and improve mood. This study tests the feasibility of an 8-week mindfulness training program for adults and adolescents with ADHD. METHOD: Twenty-four adults and eight adolescents with ADHD enrolled in a feasibility study of an 8-week mindfulness training program. RESULTS: The majority of participants completed the training and reported high satisfaction with the training. Pre-post improvements in self-reported ADHD symptoms and test performance on tasks measuring attention and cognitive inhibition were noted. Improvements in anxiety and depressive symptoms were also observed. CONCLUSION: Mindfulness training is a feasible intervention in a subset of ADHD adults and adolescents and may improve behavioral and neurocognitive impairments. A controlled clinical study is warranted.},
